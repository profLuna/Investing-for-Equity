# Analysis of evacuation-related risks in Massachusetts

This is an analysis of flood or storm surge-related evacuation risks for populations of concern in Massachusetts In the event of significant inland or coastal flooding, evacuation may be required. For individuals and households with limited mobility, either due to inadequate access to transportation options or because of physical limitations, evacuation presents heightened risk. Evacuation may also prove especially difficult for individuals and households due to limited economic resources, difficulty understanding or accessing information, or low trust in official sources of information.

# Use dasymetric mapping to calculate populations within flood zones. Approach follows method used by Qiang (2019) to eliminate unpopulated areas of census polygons and then reallocate populations to developed areas as identified in National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). 
# Perform NLCD raster-to-vector conversion, vector erase/difference, and vector intersections in ArcMap because it takes too long in R. 
# In ArcMap:
# Convert NLCD raster to shapefile. Clip to state.
# Isolate undeveloped areas (gridcode NOT 22 - 24). 
# Erase areas of ma_blkgrp_2805 and ma_tracts_2805 that overlap with undeveloped areas in NLCD shapefiles. Compute OldArea of erased polygons in sqm to identify area of developed polygons remaining. 
# Intersect erased ma_blkgrps and erased ma_tracts with NFHZA and Hurricane evacuation zones. Read back into R.

As a humid, coastal state, a significant portion of Massachusetts's land area and population are exposed to the risk of flooding from overbanking of inland water bodies (e.g., ponds and rivers) or from coastal storm surge and sea level rise. 

The analysis of flood exposure presented here is based on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL), a digital version of FEMA's most recent flood maps.  FEMA identifies areas subject to varying levels of flood risk through its Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), which are produced for most parts of the country to identify areas subject to flooding. FEMA's FIRMs are a national standard used by all federal agencies for the purposes of requiring and rating the purchase of flood insurance and regulating new development.  Population data comes from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2017 5-year estimates at the census tract and block group levels. 

A significant proportion of Massachusetts's population lives near the coast or near inland water bodies. As a result, a significant proportion of the population lives near or within known flood zones. Figure \@ref(fig:mapNFHZAPop) below shows the population distribution and areas subject to floods with an Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) of 1% (also known as a '100-year' flood) and areas subject to 0.2% AEP (also known as a '500-year' flood). Areas within the 1% AEP flood zone are designated by FEMA as Special Flood Hazard Areas, and development within those zones must be covered by flood insurance. Areas within the 0.2% AEP are not currently regulated, but these areas are nevertheless subject to flood risk under more extreme, albeit less frequent, flooding circumstances. Coastal areas within the 0.2% AEP zone are a reasonable proxy measure for the risks of sea level rise. Note that portions of northwest and northeast Massachusetts are not currently mapped for flooding risk by FEMA.

Approximately 9.2% of Massachusetts's land area falls within FEMA flood zones. The breakdown by type of flood zone is presented in Table \@ref(tab:tabNFHZAarea) below. 

```{r tabNFHZAarea, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Massachusetts Land Area within Flood Zones."}
# Total land in MA
ma_area <- as.numeric(ma_state_sf$ALAND)

# Total and percentage of land area of RI within flood zones
ma_nfhza_2805_land %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  group_by(Interval) %>% 
  summarize(SqKm = round(as.numeric(sum(Area)/10^6),1), 
            SqMi = round(as.numeric(SqKm/2.59),1),
            PctArea = paste0(as.character(round(as.numeric(sum(Area)/ma_area*100),1)),"%")) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T,
                    format.args = list(big.mark = ','),
                    caption = "Massachusetts Land Area within Flood Zones",
                    digits = 0, align = "r") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header"))
```

These percentages approximate the proportion of the total population in the state that are within these flood zones. However, exposure varies significantly by population subgroup. Table \@ref(tab:tabNFHZApop) below shows the total and percentages of the general population and various subgroups within flood zones. Aside from the total population, the largest absolute numbers of subpopulations within a flood zone are low income persons followed by minorities. The latter groups are populations of concern who may have limited mobility in the event of an evacuation. 

```{r tabNFHZApop, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Massachusetts Populations within Flood Zones."}
# Show table of pops within flood zones
ma_FloodPops_df %>% 
  mutate(PctFlood = paste0(as.character(round(PctFlood,1)),"%")) %>% 
  arrange(-FloodPop) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T,
                    format.args = list(big.mark = ','),
                    caption = "Massachusetts Populations within Flood Zones",
                    digits = 0, align = "r") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header"))
```

Some groups are disproportionately exposed to these flood hazards. While approximately 5.4% of the general population are within flood zones, limited English speaking households, households without access to a car, people in low income households, and other populations of concern, exceed the population average within flood zones. These populations of concern are overrepresented in terms of flood exposure (see Figure \@ref(fig:chartNFHZApop) below).

```{r chartNFHZApop, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Massachusetts Populations within Flood Zones."}

Massachusetts is subject to significant hurricane risk. Since 1900, Massachusetts has been struck by hurricanes 8 times, and 3 of those were major hurricanes (i.e., Category 3 or higher). The most recent hurricane to hit Massachusetts directly was [Hurricane Bob in 1991](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/the-worst-massachusetts-hurricanes-of-the-20th-century), a Category 2 storm when it struck the Cape and Islands and south shore of Massachusetts. The latter caused over $39 million in damage in Massachusetts alone and left 60% of the state without power. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 did not hit Massachusetts directly, but nevertheless resulted in flooding of Massachusetts coastal communities. In general, the Cape and Islands of Massachusetts are subject to a [hurricane return period of approximately 13 - 16 years](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/#returns), a level of risk comparable to the Gulf Coast states including Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. Boston Harbor is subject to a hurricane return period of approximately 30 years. 

Hurricane intensity is ranked from 1 to 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which is based on sustained wind speeds. However the most destructive and deadly aspects of hurricanes are due to storm surge - ocean water pushed inland by the high winds. This coastal storm surge may be combined with intense rainfall which can exacerbate flooding. As a result, coastal evacuation may be necessary as a hurricane approaches.

The analysis of hurricane evacuation risk presented here is based on Hurricane Evacuation Maps produced by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for New England. The maps show Hurricane Evacuation Zones that are recommended to be evacuated  during potential worst-case hurricane storm surge inundation. These evacuation zones are based on [storm surge modeling by the National Weather Service's National Hurricane Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/nationalsurge/) using the hydrodynamic Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model to simulate storm surge from tropical cyclones. These data products are provided to federal, state, and local government agencies to assist in planning, risk assessment studies, and operational decision-making. Population data comes from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2017 5-year estimates at the census tract and block group levels. 

A significant proportion of Massachusetts's population lives near the coast and is therefore within these hurricane evacuation zones. Figure \@ref(fig:mapHEVACPop) below shows the population distribution and areas within Hurricane Evacuation Zones. Evacuation Zone “A” is recommended to be evacuated prior to an expected category 1 or 2 hurricane.  Evacuation Zone “B” is recommended to be evacuated prior to an expected category 3 or 4 hurricane.

Approximately 6.4% of Massachusetts's land area falls within hurricane evacuation zones. The breakdown by hurricane evacuation zone is presented in Table \@ref(tab:tabHEVACarea) below.

```{r tabHEVACarea, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Massachusetts Populations within Hurricane Evacuation Zones."}
# Total and percentage of land area within hurricane evacuation zones
ma_hea_sf %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  group_by(EVACZONE) %>% 
  summarize(SqKm = round(as.numeric(sum(Area)/10^6),1), 
            SqMi = round(as.numeric(SqKm/2.59),1),
            PctArea = paste0(as.character(round(as.numeric(sum(Area)/ma_area*100),1)),"%")) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T,
                    format.args = list(big.mark = ','),
                    caption = "Massachusetts Land Area within Hurricane Evacuation Zones",

```

These percentages belie the proportion of the population in the state that are within these evacuation zones. Moreover, exposure varies significantly by population subgroup. Table \@ref(tab:tabHEVACpop) below shows the total and percentages of the general population and various subgroups within hurricane evacuation zones. Aside from the total population, the largest subpopulation within an evacuation zone are minorities and low income persons. The latter groups are populations of concern who may have limited mobility in the event of an evacuation.

Some groups are disproportionately exposed to these hurricane evacuation hazards. While approximately 14.1% of the general population are within hurricane evacuation zones, people in limited English speaking households, households without access to a car, minorities, people in low income households, adults with less than a high school education, and other popultions of concern exceed the population average within hurricane evacuation zones. These populations of concern are overrepresented in terms of hurricane evacuation exposure (see Figures \@ref(fig:chartHEVACpop) and \@ref(fig:mapHEVACPopConcern) below).
