# Analysis of transportation-related emissions in Connecticut

This is an analysis of transportation-related emissions and related externalities in Connecticut.

## Analysis of PM~2.5~ in Connecticut

This is an analysis of PM~2.5~ across Connecticut and its relationship to populations of concern. The analysis is based on data from the EPA's EJSCREEN. EJSCREEN data provides PM~2.5~ annual concentrations at the Census Block Group level for the years 2011 to 2016 (as of December 2019). 

PM~2.5~ levels vary significantly across Connecticut, with highest concentrations in southwest Connecticut, from Stamford to Hartford, and also from Providence, Rhode Island, to the Boston metro region, and from Portland, Maine along the I-95 corridor to Bangor (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapPM25CT) below).

There is a statistically significant hot spot of PM~2.5~ around Stamford, Connecticut. Warm clusters encompass southwestern  Connecticut to Hartford, from Providence, Rhode Island ot Boston, and Augusta to Bangor, Maine along the I-95 corridor. 

These PM~2.5~ levels vary significantly by state (see Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotPM25CT) below). Connecticut stands out with the highest median PM~2.5~ concentrations among the Connecticut states, while Vermont has the lowest overall concentrations. The differences in concentrations between the states are all statistically significant.

Since 2011, PM~2.5~ levels have declined across the region, on average by `r {round(mean(ct_blkgrp_sf$PM25_pctChange, na.rm = TRUE),1)}`%. Unsurprisingly, this decline has not been uniform (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapPM25CTchange) below). The greatest declines, up to 43%, have been in the northern half of Vermont and the region between Boston and Portsmouth. 

```{r mapPM25CTchange, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Map of percent change in annual PM2.5 concentrations across Connecticut between 2011 and 2016 at Census Block Group level."}

            legend.hist.width = 0.9)
```

Averaged across the states, the differences in these declines are also apparent. Figure \@ref(fig:slopegraphPM25CT) below compares the average annual PM~2.5~ concentrations by state and for the region between 2011 and 2016. The region and the states all showed significant declines since 2011, although note that concentrations in Connecticut have remained consistently well above the rest of the region.

### PM~2.5~ in Connecticut and Populations of Concern

In addition to variations in the general geography of PM~2.5~ concentrations, exposure to these pollutants also varies demographically. Figure \@ref(fig:barplotPM25PopAvgCT) below shows population-weighted exposures for populations of concern relative to average PM~2.5~ concentrations for the region. For example, minorities in Connecticut are exposed to PM~2.5~ concentrations that are more than 5% above concentrations for the region as a whole. Similarly, linguistically isolated households are exposed to concentrations 4.9% above the regional average. By contrast, persons over age 64 are, on average, exposed to concentrations of PM~2.5~ at or below the regional average.

Like the region as a whole, these populations have also experienced a decline in exposure since 2011. The comparison between exposure for these groups since 2011 is displayed below in Figure \@ref(fig:slopegraphPM25PopAvgNE). Note however that except for persons over age 64 and low income persons, all other populations of concern continue to experience exposures greater than the regional average, with minorities leading on this measure.

There are statistically significant hot spots of Ozone (O~3~) primarily around Stamford, Connecticut. A warm cluster encompasses of all Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the southwestern half of Massachusetts. 

These Ozone (O~3~) levels vary significantly by state (see Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotO3CT) below). Connecticut stands out with the highest median summer seasonal average Ozone (O~3~) concentrations among the Connecticut states, while Maine has the lowest overall concentrations. The differences in median concentrations between the states are all statistically significant.  

```{r boxplotO3CT, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Boxplot of 2016 Ozone summer seasonal average of daily maximum 8-hour concentrations in air in parts per billion by state at Census Block Group level."}

Since 2011, Ozone (O~3~) levels have increased slightly across the region, on average by `r {round(mean(ct_blkgrp_sf$OZONE_pctChange, na.rm = TRUE),1)}`%. These have changes not been uniform (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapO3CTchange) below). The greatest declines, up to 10.5%, have been in the northern half of Maine and Vermont, northeastern Vermont, southwestern Massachusetts, and southern Rhode Island. By contrast, increases in summer ozone concentrations of up to 8.1% appear in southwestern Connecticut, from Stamford to Hartford and north into western Massachusetts around Springfield. Significant increases also occur along the western border of Vermont, especially in the Champlain Valley. Minor increaes appear also in the greater Boston metro region, and southern and central Maine west and north of Portland.

```

Averaged across the states, the differences in these changes are also apparent. Figure \@ref(fig:slopegraphO3CT) below compares the average summer Ozone (O~3~) concentrations by state and for the region between 2011 and 2016. Connecticut as a whole showed a slightly less than a 1% increase in summer average Ozone concentrations, while Connecticut showed an increase of nearly 5%. Massachusetts increased as well, but by only 0.5%. All other states showed an average decline in Ozone, with Rhode Island leading (-2.6%). Although note that Rhode Island's concentrations still remain significantly above the regional average.

### Ozone (O~3~) in Connecticut and Populations of Concern

In addition to variations in the general geography of Ozone (O~3~) concentrations, exposure to this pollutant also varies demographically. Figure \@ref(fig:barplotO3PopAvgCT) below shows population-weighted exposures for populations of concern relative to average Ozone concentrations for the region. For example, minorities in Connecticut are exposed to summer Ozone concentrations that are more than 3% above concentrations for the region as a whole. Similarly, linguistically isolated households are exposed to concentrations 2.6% above the regional average. By contrast, low income persons are, on average, exposed to concentrations of Ozone at or below the regional average.

Like the region as a whole, these populations have also experienced changes in exposure since 2011. The comparison between exposure for these groups since 2011 is displayed below in Figure \@ref(fig:slopegraphO3PopAvgCT).

CO~2~ emissions vary by state (see Table \@ref(tab:statsCO2CT) and Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotCO2CT) below). Massachusetts shows highest absolute emissions.

Since 1990, CO~2~ emissions increased significantly across the region, on average by `r {round((sum(ct_blkgrp_sf$kgco2_2017, na.rm = TRUE)-sum(ct_blkgrp_sf$kgco2_1990, na.rm = TRUE))/sum(ct_blkgrp_sf$kgco2_1990, na.rm = TRUE)*100,1)}`%. These changes have not been uniform (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapCO2CTchange) below). Except for Maine, the greatest declines, up to 97%, have been in outer suburban and rural areas. By contrast, increases in CO~2~ emissions of over 600% appear across most urban cores. Boston is the notable exception where increases have been relatively modest. Dramtic increases characterize areas around Worcester, Massachusetts and the South Shore of Massachusetts and the Cape, as well as around Portland, Maine, and from Stamford to Hartford, Connecticut. Significant increases also occur west and north of Montpelier, Vermont.

```

Averaged across the states, the differences in these changes are also apparent, although less extreme than at the Census block group level. Table \@ref(tab:changeCO2CT) and Figure \@ref(fig:linegraphCO2CT) below compares the  annual CO~2~ emissions by state and for the region between 1990 and 2017. Connecticut as a whole showed an approximately 20% increase in annual CO~2~ emissions. All states showed total increases, with New Hampshire leading with a 34% increase, followed by Maine with a 26% increase. Rhode Island showed the smallest increase since 1990 (2%), although note that Rhode Island's average annual emissions still remain significantly above the regional average.

The growth in CO~2~ emissions exceeds population growth across the region and in most states as is evident in the per capita emissions (see last three columns in Table \@ref(tab:changeCO2CT)). While New Hampshire leads in percentage growth of total emissions for the region, Maine leads in per capita growth. Only Vermont and Rhode Island showed declines in per capita emissions.

In addition to variations in the general geography of CO~2~ emissions, exposure to these emissions also varies demographically. Figure \@ref(fig:barplotO3PopAvgCT) below shows population-weighted exposures for populations of concern relative to average CO~2~ emissions for the region. For example, people over age 64 in Connecticut are exposed to  CO~2~ emissions that are more than 23% above emissions for the region as a whole. Similarly, children under 5 are exposed to emissions 13% above the regional average. By contrast, persons in linguistically isolated households are, on average, exposed to emissions of CO~2~ at almost 22% below the regional average.

The comparison between exposure for these groups since 1990 is displayed below in Figure \@ref(fig:slopegraphCO2PopAvgCT).

### Diesel Particulate Matter in Connecticut and Populations of Concern

In addition to variations in the general geography of Diesel Particulate Matter concentrations, exposure to these concentrations also varies demographically. Figure \@ref(fig:barplotDPMPopAvgCT) below shows population-weighted exposures for populations of concern relative to average Diesel Particulate Matter concentraions for the region. For example, linguistically isolated households in Connecticut are exposed to  Diesel Particulate Matter concentrations that are more than 45% above concentrations for the region as a whole. Similarly, minorities are exposed to concentrations more than 30% above the regional average. By contrast, persons over age 64 are, on average, exposed to concentrations of Diesel Particulate Matter 9% below the regional average.

### Lifetime Cancer Risk from Inhalation of Air Toxics in Connecticut and Populations of Concern

In addition to variations in the general geography of Diesel Particulate Matter concentrations, exposure to these concentrations also varies demographically. Figure \@ref(fig:barplotATCPopAvgCT) below shows population-weighted exposures for populations of concern relative to average Lifetime Cancer Risk from Inhalation of Air Toxics for the region. For example, linguistically isolated households in Connecticut experience lifetime cancer risks from inhalation of air toxics that are 11% above the region as a whole. Similarly, minorities are experience lifetime cancer risks of 9% above the regional average. By contrast, persons over age 64 are, on average, exposed to concentrations of Diesel Particulate Matter 2% below the regional average.

## Analysis of Traffic Proximity and Volume in Connecticut

Traffic Proximity and Volume is a count of vehicles (average annual daily traffic) at major roads within 500 meters, divided by distance in kilometers (km). It was calculated from 2017 U.S. DOT traffic data and the data for this analysis was sourced from EPA’s EJSCREEN database. Exposure to high annual daily traffic volume is concentrated around major cities in Connecticut and radiates outward along major traffic routes (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapTPVCT) below).

Traffic Proximity and Volume exposure vary by state (see Table \@ref(tab:statsTPVCT) and Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotTPVCT) below). Massachusetts shows the highest Traffic Proximity and Volume exposure, followed distantly by Connecticut, and Rhode Island.

### Traffic Proximity and Volume Exposure in Connecticut and Populations of Concern

In addition to variations in the general geography of the Traffic Proximity and Volume exposure, this exposure also varies demographically. Figure \@ref(fig:barplotTPVPopAvgNE) below shows population-weighted exposures for populations of concern relative to average Traffic Proximity and Volume for the region. For example, linguistically isolated households in Connecticut are exposed to Traffic Proximity and Volume at more than twice the level of the region as a whole (over 104%). Similarly, minorities are exposed to Traffic Proximity and Volume more than 57% above the regional average. By contrast, persons over age 64 are, on average, are exposed to Traffic Proximity and Volume of more than 22% below the regional average.

Language isolated households and minorities experience higher exposure to traffic proximity and volume compared to the general population. There is a moderate positive correlation between the proportions of minorities and traffic proximity and volume, and a moderate positive correlation with language isolated households (see Figure \@ref(fig:cormatrixTPVPopAvg) below.).
