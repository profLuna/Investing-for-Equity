# Analysis of evacuation-related risks in Vermont

This is an analysis of flood evacuation risks for priority populations in Vermont. In the event of significant inland flooding, evacuation may be required. For individuals and households with limited mobility, either due to inadequate access to transportation options or because of physical limitations, evacuation presents heightened risk. Evacuation may also prove especially difficult for individuals and households due to limited economic resources, difficulty understanding or accessing information, or low trust in official sources of information.

# Use dasymetric mapping to calculate populations within flood zones. Approach follows method used by Qiang (2019) to eliminate unpopulated areas of census polygons and then reallocate populations to developed areas as identified in National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). 
# Perform NLCD raster-to-vector conversion, vector erase/difference, and vector intersections in ArcMap because it takes too long in R. 
# In ArcMap:
# Convert NLCD raster to shapefile. Clip to state.
# Isolate undeveloped areas (gridcode NOT 22 - 24). 
# Erase areas of vt_blkgrp_2852 and vt_tracts_2852 that overlap with undeveloped areas in NLCD shapefiles. Compute OldArea of erased polygons in sqm to identify area of developed polygons remaining. 
# Intersect erased vt_blkgrps and erased vt_tracts with NFHZA and Hurricane evacuation zones. Read back into R.

In comparison to other part's of New England, relatively little of Vermont's land area is within flood zones. However, a significant proportion of the population are nevertheless exposed to the risk of flooding from overbanking of inland water bodies (e.g., ponds and rivers). 

The analysis of flood exposure presented here is based on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL), a digital version of FEMA's most recent flood maps.[^NFHL]  FEMA identifies areas subject to varying levels of flood risk through its Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), which are produced for most parts of the country to identify areas subject to flooding. FEMA's FIRMs are a national standard used by all federal agencies for the purposes of requiring and rating the purchase of flood insurance and regulating new development.  Population data comes from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018 5-year estimates at the census tract and block group levels. 

A significant proportion of Vermont's population lives near inland water bodies. As a result, a significant proportion of the population lives near or within known flood zones. Figure \@ref(fig:mapNFHZAPop) below shows the population distribution and areas subject to floods with an Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) of 1% (also known as a '100-year' flood) and areas subject to 0.2% AEP (also known as a '500-year' flood). Areas within the 1% AEP flood zone are designated by FEMA as Special Flood Hazard Areas, and development within those zones must be covered by flood insurance. Areas within the 0.2% AEP are not currently regulated, but these areas are nevertheless subject to flood risk under more extreme, albeit less frequent, flooding circumstances. Coastal areas within the 0.2% AEP zone are a reasonable proxy measure for the risks of sea level rise. Note that portions of northwest and northeast Vermont are not currently mapped for flooding risk by FEMA.

Approximately 1.9% of Vermont's land area falls within FEMA flood zones. The breakdown by type of flood zone is presented in Table \@ref(tab:tabNFHZAarea) below. 

```{r tabNFHZAarea, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Vermont Land Area within Flood Zones."}
# Total land in VT
vt_area <- as.numeric(vt_state_sf$ALAND)

# Total and percentage of land area of RI within flood zones
vt_nfhza_2852_land %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  group_by(Interval) %>% 
  summarize(SqKm = round(as.numeric(sum(Area)/10^6),1), 
            SqMi = round(as.numeric(SqKm/2.59),1),
            PctArea = paste0(as.character(round(as.numeric(sum(Area)/vt_area*100),1)),"%")) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T,
                    format.args = list(big.mark = ','),
                    caption = "Vermont Land Area within Flood Zones",
                    digits = 0, align = "r") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header"))
```

The proportion of the total state population living within flood zones exceeds the percentage of the state area within flood zones. Moreover, exposure varies by population subgroup. Table \@ref(tab:tabNFHZApop) below shows the total and percentages of the general population and various subgroups living within flood zones. Aside from the total population, the largest absolute numbers of subpopulations living within a flood zone are low income persons followed by those under 18 and over 64. The latter groups are priority populations who may have limited mobility in the event of an evacuation. 

```{r tabNFHZApop, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Vermont Populations Living within Flood Zones."}
# Show table of pops within flood zones
vt_FloodPops_df %>% 
  mutate(PctFlood = paste0(as.character(round(PctFlood,1)),"%")) %>% 
  arrange(-FloodPop) %>% 
  mutate(Group = recode(Group, "Minority" = "People of Color",
                        "No HS Dip" = "No HS Diploma")) %>%
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T,
                    format.args = list(big.mark = ','),
                    caption = "Vermont Populations Living within Flood Zones",
                    digits = 0, align = "r") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header"))
```

Some groups are disproportionately exposed to these flood hazards. While approximately 5.7% of the general population are living within flood zones, limited English speaking households, households without access to a car, people in low income households, and other priority populations, exceed the population average living within flood zones. These priority populations are disproportionately exposed to flood risk (see Figure \@ref(fig:chartNFHZApop) below).

# Appendix A: Data and Methodology {-}

The analyses presented here are based on data from five sources:

* FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL)
* MRLC National Land Cover Database (NLCD)
* State Hurricane Evacuation Zones (CT,MA,RI)
* NOAA Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model
* American Community Survey 5-year Estimates
  + Population demographics

## FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) {-}

As part of the National Flood Insurance Program, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) produces maps of flood risk across the nation. These flood risk maps are based on . 

The National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) is a digital geospatial database that contains current effective flood hazard mapping data from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agnecy's (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). NFHL data is available for download at https://msc.fema.gov/portal/advanceSearch. This geodatabase identifies areas subject to various levels of flood risk as determined by FEMA, consistent with Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), based upon hydrodynamic models as well as historic flooding. 

This analysis focused on identifying populations at risk from floods with a 1% or 0.2% annual exceedance probability. The 1% annual exceedance probability flood, sometimes referred to as a '100-year' flood, is a flood with a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in a given year. Areas subject to the 1% flood risk are designated as Special Flood Hazard Areas. Properties within these these flood risk zones are required to carry flood insurance in order to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program. The 0.2% exceedance probability flood, sometimes referred to as a '500-year' flood, is a flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or exceeded in a given year. There is no federal regulatory requirement for properties within areas subject to 0.2% annual exceedance probability flood risk. While lower risk, these areas are frequently identified as areas subject to flooding under extreme or worst case scenarios. Note that FEMA flood risk designations do not take into consideration increasing or projected flood risk due to sea level rise, more extreme rainfall events, or other climate change-enhanced risks.[^Bruggers2018] 

In order to identify populations at risk from floods with a 1% or 0.2% annual exceedance probability, NFHL polygons pertaining to the 1% flood risk (zones A, AE, AH, AO, and VE) and the 0.2% flood risk (zone X), and excluding water or areas of "minimal flood hazard," were extracted and intersected with the developed portions of Census Block Groups. Developed portions of Census Block Groups were identified based upon the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), using a process of areal apportionment (see below). The population at risk from flooding was calculated as the product of the  areal proportion of the intersecting flood and developed Block Group polygons:

*Population at risk = Proportion of developed Block Group Intersection x Population of developed Block Group*

For example, if 10% of the developed area of a Census Block Group intersected/overlapped with a flood polygon, it was assumed that 10% of the population is exposed to that flood risk. Assuming a population of 100 people in the developed portion of the Block Group, this would mean *100 x .10 = 10* people would be subject to flood risk. FEMA flood risk modeling was done in R.


## MRLC National Land Cover Database (NLCD) {-}

The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) provides nationwide data on land cover and land cover change at a 30m resolution with a 16-class legend based on a modified Anderson Level II classification system:

```{r NLCDtab}
gridCodes <- c(11,12,21,22,23,24,31,41,42,43,51,52,71,72,73,74,81,82,90,95)

landUse <- c("Open Water", "Perennial Ice/Snow", "Developed, Open Space", "Developed, Low Intensity", "Developed, Medium Intensity", "Developed, High Intensity", "Barren Land (Rock/Sand/Clay)", "Deciduous Forest", "Evergreen Forest", "Mixed Forest", "Dwarf Scrub", "Shrub/Scrub", "Grassland/Herbaceous", "Sedge/Herbaceous", "Lichens", "Moss", "Pasture/Hay", "Cultivated Crops", "Woody Wetlands", "Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands")

data.frame(gridCodes,landUse) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T,
                    col.names = c("GRID Code","Land Use Description"),
                    caption = "NLCD 2016 Land Cover Codes and Classifications", align = "l") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header"))
```

The NLCD is produced by the US Geological Survey (USGS) in partnership with several federal agencies as part of the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC).[^NLCD2016] NLCD identified land cover types based on semi-automated land use calssification algorithms applied to LANDSAT satellite imagery and supplemented with ancillary data.[^NLCDdetails] NLCD is distributed as a raster GeoTIFF at https://www.mrlc.gov/data. 

NLCD data was used to identify developed areas of Census Block Groups in order to better estimate potential flood risk in areas where people are most likely to reside.[^Dasymetric] The NLCD 2016 was downloaded and converted to a vector polygon layer and clipped to New England states. Undeveloped polygon areas were extracted (all GRID codes excluding 22 - 24; see Table \@ref(tab:NLCDtab)). These undeveloped areas of the NLCD polygon layer were then used to erase overlapping areas of Census Block Groups. The latter step served to eliminate areas of Census Block Groups that were classified as undeveloped and thus unlikely to be occupied by residences. The remaining developed areas of Census Block Groups were assumed to contain all populations assigned to that respective Block Group. Processing of NLCD and developed Census Block Groups was done in ArcGIS Desktop 10.7. These developed Census Block Group polygons were used for identifying populations at risk from flooding or hurricane storm surge.

## State Hurricane Evacuation Zones (CT,MA,RI) {-}

Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island provide maps and geospatial layers identifying evacuation zones in their respective states in the event of a hurricane. These hurricane evaucation zone maps were developed in cooperation between state emergency management agencies and the U.S. Army Corps of Enginneers. Hurricane storm surge risk was based on the SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) model, which is a numerical model used by the National Weather Service to compute storm surge. Hurricane evaucation zones generally encompass an area larger than the specific areas subject to inundation. 
Connecticut Hurricane Evacuation Zones: https://data.ct.gov/Public-Safety/Hurricane-Evacuation-Zones-2014-/kdsj-af66
Massachusetts Hurricane Evacuation Zones: https://www.nae.usace.army.mil/Missions/Projects-Topics/Massachusetts-Hurricane-Studies/
Rhode Island Hurricane Evacuation Zones: http://www.riema.ri.gov/resources/citizens/prepare/evacuation.php 

In order to identify populations at risk from hurricane evacuation, hurricane evacuation zone polygons were intersected with the developed portions of Census Block Groups. Developed portions of Census Block Groups were identified based upon the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), using a process of areal apportionment (see above). The population at risk from hurricane evacuation risk was calculated as the product of the  areal proportion of the intersecting evacuation zone and developed Block Group polygons:

*Population at risk = Proportion of developed Block Group Intersection x Population of developed Block Group*

For example, if 10% of the developed area of a Census Block Group intersected/overlapped with a hurricane evacuation zone, it was assumed that 10% of the population is exposed to that evacuation risk. Assuming a population of 100 people in the developed portion of the Block Group, this would mean *100 x .10 = 10* people would be subject to hurricane evacuation risk. 

## NOAA Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model (ME,NH) {-}

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), specifically the National Weather Service's (NWS) National Hurricane Center (NHC), utilizes the hydrodynamic Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model to simulate storm surge from tropical cyclones, including hurricanes. SLOSH models of coastal storm surge are based on tens of thousands of climatology-based hypothetical tropical cyclone simulations.[^SurgeModel]  The composite results of these simulations are used to assess and visualize storm surge risk under varying conditions. Maps and estimates of risk are provided to federal, state, and local partners to assist in a range of planning processes, risk assessment studies, and operational decision-making. SLOSH models and maps are the basis of state-level hurricane evacuation zone designations. However, only three of the six New England states (Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island) have developed hurricane evacuation zone maps. Maine and New Hampshire, which are subject to hurricane risk, have not developed, or do not publicly offer, hurricane evacuation zone maps. In order to model hurricane evacuation risk in those states, SLOSH inundation zones were used instead. The use of storm surge inundation risk, rather than hurricane evacuation zones, likely underestimates the population that would be subject to evacuation in the event of an approaching hurricane.

In order to identify populations at risk from hurricane evacuation in Maine and New Hampshire, SLOSH surge hazard maps were downloaded from the National Hurricane Center in the form of GeoTIFF raster files.[^SurgeModel] Specifically, scenarios for Category 2 and Category 4 hurricanes at high tide were used. The raster files were clipped to the land areas of Maine and New Hampshire and converted to a vector polygon layer and merged. Hurricane storm surge polygons were intersected with the developed portions of Census Block Groups. Developed portions of Census Block Groups were identified based upon the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), using a process of areal apportionment (see above). The population at risk from hurricane storm surge risk was calculated as the product of the areal proportion of the intersecting storm surge polygons and developed Block Group polygons:

*Population at risk = Proportion of developed Block Group Intersection x Population of developed Block Group*

For example, if 10% of the developed area of a Census Block Group intersected/overlapped with a hurricane storm surge polygon, it was assumed that 10% of the population is exposed to that flood risk. Assuming a population of 100 people in the developed portion of the Block Group, this would mean *100 x .10 = 10* people would be subject to hurricane storm surge risk. Processing of SLOSH GeoTIFF files and polygon intersection were performed in ArcGIS 10.7. 


## American Community Survey 5-year Estimates {-}

The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey by the U.S. Census Bureau that provides information on a yearly basis about the U.S. and its people. The ACS provides detailed information on economic, housing, and demographic characteristics about the population that are not captured by the decennial Census. 

The ACS provides greater demographic detail and temporal resolution than the decennial Census, but its geographic resolution is more limited. While the decennial Census is based on an enumeration (i.e., a total count) of everyone in the U.S. once every decade, the ACS is based on a statistical sample of approximately 3.5 million addresses across the country each year. As a result of this sampling approach, the ACS estimates must be pooled, or combined, across multiple years in order to provide reliable estimates for smaller areas (i.e. areas with less than 20,000 people), such as at the Tract or Block Group levels. While it is possible to know the number of low income households across the U.S. annually, one may only know this about a Tract or Block Group based on 5-year estimates. Since 2010, the ACS has published 5-year data (beginning with 2005–2009 estimates) for all geographic areas down to the census Tract and Block Group levels. For more detail on the ACS, see Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: What All Data Users Need to Know at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/handbooks/general.html.

All data was analyzed or aggregated geographically by Census Tract and Block Group. A Census Tract is a small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision of a county that contains between 1,200 and 8,000 people. The entire area of a county is covered by Census Tracts, just as the entire area of a state is covered by counties or county equivalents. Census Tracts range in areal size depending on the population density; areal sizes are smaller in denser areas and larger in less densely populated areas. Census Block Groups are subdivisions of Census Tracts that contain between 600 and 3,000 people. Like Tracts, Block Groups range in areal size depending on the population density of the area. Block Groups are the smallest geographic unit at which detailed demographic and household data from the American Community Survey is made available by the U.S. Census Bureau. 

For the purposes of this analysis ACS 5-year estimates for the period 2014 - 2018 for Census Tracts and Block Groups in New England, as well as their associated TIGER/Line spatial files, were downloaded from the Census Bureau via API using the `tigris` package in R. Demographic variables consistent with those used by the EPA in EJSCREEN were chosen, as well as environmental justice population thresholds used by states where available. Table \@ref(tab:ACSvariables) below lists the demographic variables that were downloaded directly or computed from ACS variables:
