# Analysis of evacuation-related risks in New Hampshire

This is an analysis of flood or storm surge-related evacuation risks for populations of concern in New Hampshire In the event of significant inland or coastal flooding, evacuation may be required. For individuals and households with limited mobility, either due to inadequate access to transportation options or because of physical limitations, evacuation presents heightened risk. Evacuation may also prove especially difficult for individuals and households due to limited economic resources, difficulty understanding or accessing information, or low trust in official sources of information.

# Use dasymetric mapping to calculate populations within flood zones. Approach follows method used by Qiang (2019) to eliminate unpopulated areas of census polygons and then reallocate populations to developed areas as identified in National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). 
# Perform NLCD raster-to-vector conversion, vector erase/difference, and vector intersections in ArcMap because it takes too long in R. 
# In ArcMap:
# Convert NLCD raster to shapefile. Clip to state.
# Isolate undeveloped areas (gridcode NOT 22 - 24). 
# Erase areas of nh_blkgrp_2823 and nh_tracts_2823 that overlap with undeveloped areas in NLCD shapefiles. Compute OldArea of erased polygons in sqm to identify area of developed polygons remaining. 
# Intersect erased nh_blkgrps and erased nh_tracts with NFHZA and Hurricane evacuation zones. Read back into R.

As a humid, coastal state, a significant portion of New Hampshire's land area and population are exposed to the risk of flooding from overbanking of inland water bodies (e.g., ponds and rivers) or from coastal storm surge and sea level rise. 

The analysis of flood exposure presented here is based on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL), a digital version of FEMA's most recent flood maps.  FEMA identifies areas subject to varying levels of flood risk through its Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), which are produced for most parts of the country to identify areas subject to flooding. FEMA's FIRMs are a national standard used by all federal agencies for the purposes of requiring and rating the purchase of flood insurance and regulating new development.  Population data comes from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2017 5-year estimates at the census tract and block group levels. 

A significant proportion of New Hampshire's population lives near the coast or near inland water bodies. As a result, a significant proportion of the population lives near or within known flood zones. Figure \@ref(fig:mapNFHZAPop) below shows the population distribution and areas subject to floods with an Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) of 1% (also known as a '100-year' flood) and areas subject to 0.2% AEP (also known as a '500-year' flood). Areas within the 1% AEP flood zone are designated by FEMA as Special Flood Hazard Areas, and development within those zones must be covered by flood insurance. Areas within the 0.2% AEP are not currently regulated, but these areas are nevertheless subject to flood risk under more extreme, albeit less frequent, flooding circumstances. Coastal areas within the 0.2% AEP zone are a reasonable proxy measure for the risks of sea level rise. Note that portions of northwest and northeast New Hampshire are not currently mapped for flooding risk by FEMA.

These percentages approximate the proportion of the total population in the state that are within these flood zones. However, exposure varies significantly by population subgroup. Table \@ref(tab:tabNFHZApop) below shows the total and percentages of the general population and various subgroups within flood zones. Aside from the total population, the largest absolute numbers of subpopulations within a flood zone are low income persons followed by people under 18 or over 64. The latter groups are populations of concern who may have limited mobility in the event of an evacuation.

Some groups are disproportionately exposed to these flood hazards. While approximately 5.8% of the general population are within flood zones, households without access to a car, people with disabilities, people in low income households, and other populations of concern, exceed the population average within flood zones. These populations of concern are overrepresented in terms of flood exposure (see Figure \@ref(fig:chartNFHZApop) below).

New Hampshire is subject to hurricane risk. Since 1900, New Hampshire has been struck by hurricanes twice. The most recent hurricane to hit New Hampshire directly was [Hurricane Bob in 1991](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/the-worst-New Hampshire-hurricanes-of-the-20th-century), a Category 2 storm when it struck the  south shore of New Hampshire. The latter caused over \$2.3 million in damages in New Hampshire alone and left 20% of the state without power. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 did not hit New Hampshire directly, but nevertheless resulted in flooding of New Hampshire coastal communities that resulted in over \$1.6 million in damanges. In general, New Hampshire is subject to a [hurricane return period of approximately 30 years](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/#returns). 

Hurricane intensity is ranked from 1 to 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which is based on sustained wind speeds. However the most destructive and deadly aspects of hurricanes are due to storm surge - ocean water pushed inland by the high winds. This coastal storm surge may be combined with intense rainfall which can exacerbate flooding. As a result, coastal evacuation may be necessary as a hurricane approaches.

The analysis of hurricane evacuation risk presented here is based on [storm surge modeling by the National Weather Service's National Hurricane Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/nationalsurge/) using the hydrodynamic Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model to simulate storm surge from tropical cyclones. These data products are provided to federal, state, and local government agencies to assist in planning, risk assessment studies, and operational decision-making. Population data comes from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2017 5-year estimates at the census tract and block group levels. 

A significant proportion of New Hampshire's population lives near the coast and is therefore within areas subject to inundation due to hurrican storm surge. Figure \@ref(fig:mapHEVACPop) below shows the population distribution and areas subject to hurricane inundation. Zone “A” is recommended to be evacuated prior to an expected category 1 or 2 hurricane.  Zone “B” is recommended to be evacuated prior to an expected category 3 or 4 hurricane.

Approximately 0.3% of New Hampshire's land area falls within areas subject to hurricane inundation. The breakdown by hurricane inundation zone is presented in Table \@ref(tab:tabHEVACarea) below.

```{r tabHEVACarea, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="New Hampshire Populations within Hurricane Inundation Zones."}

```

These percentages belie the proportion of the population in the state that are within these inundation zones. Exposure varies significantly by population subgroup. Table \@ref(tab:tabHEVACpop) below shows the total and percentages of the general population and various subgroups within hurricane inundation zones. Aside from the total population, the largest subpopulation within an inundation zone are individuals over age 64 and low income individuals. The latter groups are populations of concern who may have limited mobility in the event of an evacuation.

Some groups are disproportionately exposed to these hurricane evacuation hazards. While approximately 1.1% of the general population are within hurricane inundation zones, individuals over age 64 and households without access to a car exceed the population average within hurricane inundation zones. These populations of concern are overrepresented in terms of hurricane evacuation exposure (see Figures \@ref(fig:chartHEVACpop) and \@ref(fig:mapHEVACPopConcern) below).
