# Analysis of transportation-related emissions in Maine

This is an analysis of transportation-related emissions and related externalities in Maine.

## PM~2.5~ in Maine

PM~2.5~ refers to particulate matter in the air that is 2.5 microns or less in diameter (about 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair). These small particulates pose a threat to human health because they can penetrate deeply into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream. The EPA has documented that exposure to PM~2.5~ is associated with health effects such as elevated risk of premature mortality from cardiovascular diseases or lung cancer, and increased health problems such as asthma attacks.[^EPAPM10] Moreover, the EPA has found that people with pre-existing heart or lung disease, children and older adults, and nonwhite populations are at particular risk.[^EPAPM10risk]

Sources of PM~2.5~ emissions include power plants and industrial facilities that burn coal or petroleum-based fuels (i.e., oil or natural gas). However, most PM~2.5~ forms in the atmosphere as a result of chemical reactions between gases such as oxides of nitrogen (NO~x~) or sulfur dioxide (SO~2~), which are pollutants emitted from power plants, industries, and automobiles. PM~2.5~ has been regulated by the US EPA under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) since 1997. As of April 2020, the EPA's primary (health-based) standard for PM~2.5~ is an annual average of 12$\mu$g/m^3^ (12 micrograms per cubic meter of air).[^EPAPM25standards] Research shows that PM~2.5~ continues to have a significant negative impact on mortality at concentrations below the EPA's standard.[^LOWPM25research] Former EPA officials and scientists in an Independent Particulate Matter Review Panel have found that the current standard is not protective of public health and recommend that the annual standard be revised to a range of 10$\mu$g/m^3^ to 8$\mu$g/m^3^. However, even at the lower end of the range, risk is not reduced to zero.[^IPMRP]

The analysis of PM~2.5~ presented here is based on data from the EPA's EJSCREEN.[^EJSCREEN] EJSCREEN data provides PM~2.5~ annual concentrations at the Census Block Group level for the years 2011 to 2016 (as of December 2019). 

PM~2.5~ levels vary significantly across Maine, with highest concentrations in the southeast from Saco to Bangor along I-95 (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapPM25) below).

There is a statistically significant hot spot of PM~2.5~ from Augusta to Bangor. Warm clusters extend across the southeast from Saco to Bangor. 

These PM~2.5~ levels vary significantly across the state (see Table \@ref(tab:statsPM) and Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotPM)). See Table \@ref(tab:PollutantByTown) in Appendix B for concentrations by municipality.

The Block Group with highest PM~2.5~ concentration value in the state is found in `r me_town_max` and the lowest is found in `r me_town_min`. See Table \@ref(tab:PollutantByTown) in Appendix B for concentrations by municipality.

Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotPM25) is a boxplot of PM~2.5~ concentrations by Block Group . The box represents concentration values ranging between the 25th and 75th percentiles. The line that divides the box into two parts represents the median PM~2.5~ concentration for all Block Groups, which in this case is `r round(median(me_blkgrp_sf$PM25_19, na.rm = TRUE),2)`. Half of the state's Block Groups are below the median and half are above the median. Each dot represents an individual Block Group. Large black dots on left represent outliers, or unusually low values relative to the state. 

```{r boxplotPM25, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Boxplot of 2016 annual PM2.5 concentrations at Census Block Group level. 1 dot = 1 Block Group."}
# boxplot of PM2.5 by state for 2016

```

Since 2011, PM~2.5~ levels have declined across the state, on average by `r {round(mean(me_blkgrp_sf$PM25_pctChange, na.rm = TRUE),1)}`%. Unsurprisingly, this decline has not been uniform (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapPM25change) below). The greatest declines, up to `r {round(min(me_blkgrp_sf$PM25_pctChange, na.rm = TRUE),1)}`%, have been in the south (around Saco) and northeast (around Presque Isle) of the state.

### PM~2.5~ in Maine and Populations of Concern

In addition to variations in the general geography of PM~2.5~ concentrations, exposure to these pollutants also varies demographically. Figure \@ref(fig:barplotPM25PopAvg) below shows population-weighted exposures for populations of concern relative to average PM~2.5~ concentrations for the state. For example, limited English speaking households are exposed to PM~2.5~ concentrations that are over 1.7% above concentrations for the state as a whole. By contrast, adults without a high school diploma are exposed to concentrations at or below the state average.

## Ozone (O~3~) in Maine

Ground-level ozone (O~3~) is the primary constituent of smog.[^NOTO3hole] However, ozone is not usually emitted directly into the air. It is created at ground level by a chemical reaction in the air between oxides of nitrogen (NO~x~) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. These ozone precursor pollutants are emitted from automobile exhaust, gasoline vapors, industrial boilers, refineries, chemical plants, and other sources. Ozone concentrations tend to be highest during the summer months due to increased sunlight and heat. Ozone can also be carried long distances by wind, affecting areas far from the sources of precursor pollutants.

The EPA has documented an association between exposure to ambient ozone and a variety of health outcomes, including reduction in lung function, increased inflammation and increased hospital admissions and mortality.[^EPAPM10risk] People most at risk from breathing air containing ozone include people with asthma, children, older adults, and people who are active outdoors, especially outdoor workers. Children are at greatest risk from exposure to ozone because their lungs are still developing and they are more likely to be active outdoors when ozone levels are high, which increases their exposure.  Children are also more likely than adults to have asthma.[^O3risks] 

Ground level ozone has been regulated by the US EPA under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) since 1971. As of April 2020, the EPA's primary (health-based) standard for ground level ozone is 70 parts per billion (ppb).[^EPAO3standards] However, the EPA has acknowledged that clinical and epidemiological evidence has been inconclusive about a possible threshold for ozone-induced health effects. EPA concluded that if a population threshold level exists, it is near the lower limit of ambient ozone concentrations in the United States.[^EPAO3lowerlimit]

The analysis of ozone (O~3~) presented here is based on data from the EPA's EJSCREEN.[^EJSCREEN] EJSCREEN data provides ozone (O~3~) May–September (summer/ ozone season) average of daily-maximum 8-hour-average ozone concentrations, in parts per billion (ppb), at the Census Block Group level for the years 2011 to 2016 (as of December 2019).

Ozone (O~3~) levels vary significantly across Maine, with highest concentrations along the coast from Kittery to Bar Harbor (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapO3) below).[^NONATTAINMENT]

These ozone levels vary significantly across the state (see Table \@ref(tab:statsO3) and Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotO3)). See Table \@ref(tab:PollutantByTown) in Appendix B for concentrations by municipality.

The Block Group with highest O~3~ concentration value in the state is found in `r me_town_max` and the lowest is found in `r me_town_min`. See Table \@ref(tab:PollutantByTown) in Appendix B for concentrations by municipality. 

Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotO3) is a boxplot of O~3~ concentrations by Block Group . The box represents concentration values ranging between the 25th and 75th percentiles. The line that divides the box into two parts represents the median O~3~ concentration for all Block Groups, which in this case is `r round(median(me_blkgrp_sf$OZONE_19, na.rm = TRUE),2)`. Half of the state's Block Groups are below the median and half are above the median. Each dot represents an individual Block Group. Large black dots represent outliers, or Block Groups with values that are unusually high or low relative to the state. In this case, outliers would be represented by ozone values greater than `r Outlier`, which occur in `r glue::glue_collapse(me_town_outlier,", ", last = ", and ")`.

These have changes not been uniform (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapO3change) below). The greatest declines, up to `r round(min(me_blkgrp_sf$OZONE_pctChange, na.rm = TRUE),1)`%, have been in the north central part of the state. By contrast, increases in summer ozone concentrations of up to `r round(max(me_blkgrp_sf$OZONE_pctChange, na.rm = TRUE),1)`% appear south of Bethel and also around Bangor.

### Ozone (O~3~) in Maine and Populations of Concern

In addition to variations in the general geography of Ozone (O~3~) concentrations, exposure to this pollutant also varies demographically. Figure \@ref(fig:barplotO3PopAvg) below shows population-weighted exposures for populations of concern relative to average Ozone concentrations for the region. For example, persons over age 64 in Maine are exposed to summer Ozone concentrations that are approximately 0.5% above concentrations for the state as a whole. By contrast, adults without a high school diploma are, on average, exposed to concentrations of Ozone almost 1% below the state average.

## Carbon Dioxide (CO~2~) in Maine

Carbon dioxide (CO~2~) emissions are the primary driver of human-induced climate change.[^GWFAQ] Direct exposure to CO~2~ is not a significant health concern, but its cumulative effects on the climate and global environment are. In addition to risks such as sea level rise, increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather (e.g., flooding, storms, droughts, heat waves), and economic disruption, climate change is likely to degrade air quality by exacerbating smog formation and other airborne irritants.[^UCSO3] The single largest source of CO~2~ emissions is the transportation sector, especially automobiles. Other sources of CO~2~ emissions include the combustion of coal or petroleum-based fuels for  electricity production, industry, heating of commercial and residential buildings, agriculture, and land use and forestry.[^GHGInventory] 

In 2007, the US Supreme Court ruled that CO~2~ is a pollutant under the terms of the Clean Air Act and therefore the EPA has statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (METSA) subsequently issued new fuel economy standards which included GHG standards for light-duty vehicles (passenger cars and trucks) for model years 2012 - 2016 and then model years 2017 - 2025. The latter required auto manufacturers to reduce average GHG emissions by approximately 23% by 2026.[^CAFECO2rule] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global authority on climate change science and policy, has warned that the world must bring GHG emissions down to "net zero" as soon as possible in order to avoid catastrophic climate change.[^IPCC] 

The analysis of carbon dioxide (CO~2~) presented here is based on data from the Database of Road Transportation Emissions (DARTE), a product of the NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS). DARTE provides CO~2~ emissions from on-road transportation annually for 1980-2017 as a continuous surface at a spatial resolution of 1 km and also aggregated at the Census Block Group level.[^DARTE]

On-road CO~2~ emissions closely follow major roadways across the region (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapCO2) below).

The Block Group with highest CO~2~ emissions value in the state is found in `r me_town_maxCO2` and the lowest is found in `r me_town_minCO2`.

Since 1990, CO~2~ emissions increased across the state, on average by `r {round((sum(me_blkgrp_sf$kgco2_2017, na.rm = TRUE)-sum(me_blkgrp_sf$kgco2_1990, na.rm = TRUE))/sum(me_blkgrp_sf$kgco2_1990, na.rm = TRUE)*100,1)}`%. These changes have not been uniform (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapCO2change) below). Declines have occurred in the west and northeast. Increased emissions have occurred in throughout the south and central areas of the state, with the greatest emissions growth in the south between Kittery and Portland.

At the state level the differences in these changes are also apparent, although less extreme than at the Census block group level.

Maine saw dramatic growth in CO~2~ emissions between 1990 and 2003 and again between 2009 and 2016. Moreover, emissions growth has exceeded population growth. This is reflected in the increase in per capita emissions since 1990 (see last three columns in Table \@ref(tab:changeCO2)).

## Diesel Particulate Matter in Maine

Diesel Particulate Matter (DPM) refers to particulate matter generated from the combustion of diesel fuel. DPM mass (expressed as $\mu$gDPM/m^3^) has historically been used as a surrogate measure of exposure for diesel exhaust more generally. Diesel exhaust is a complex mixture of thousands of gases and fine particles that contains more than 40 toxic air contaminants.  These include many known or suspected cancer-causing substances, such as benzene, arsenic and formaldehyde.  It also contains other harmful pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (a component of smog). In addition to long term cancer risk, exposure to diesel exhaust can have immediate health effects.  It can irritate the eyes, nose, throat and lungs, and it can cause coughs, headaches, light-headedness and nausea. Exposure to diesel exhaust also causes inflammation in the lungs, which may aggravate chronic respiratory symptoms and increase the frequency or intensity of asthma attacks.[^DPMcalEPA] 

Major sources of diesel exhaust include engines and motorized vehicles that use diesel fuel, such as trucks, buses, trains, ships, and diesel-powered generators. DPM is classified by the EPA as a Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP). HAPs are pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental effects. The EPA has not quantified the cancer risk from exposure to DPM. However, it has established a diesel exhaust reference concentration (RfC) for noncancer health effects. The RfC is 5 $\mu$g/m^3^ for diesel exhaust measured as diesel particulate matter (DPM). This RfC does not consider allergenic effects such as those associated with asthma, immunologic effects or the potential for cardiac effects.[^NATA2014]

The analysis of DPM presented here is based on data from the EPA's EJSCREEN.[^EJSCREEN] EJSCREEN data provides annual DPM concentrations, in micrograms per cubic meter of air ($\mu$g/m^3^), at the Census Block Group level for 2014, the latest year of data available from the National Air Toxics Assessment.

DPM emissions are concentrated along the I-95 corridor from Kittery to Bangor (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapDPM) below).

The Block Group with highest Diesel Particulate Matter emissions value in the state is found in `r me_town_maxDPM` and the lowest is found in `r me_town_minDPM`.

Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotDPM) is a boxplot of DPM concentrations by Block Group . The box represents concentration values ranging between the 25th and 75th percentiles. The line that divides the box into two parts represents the median DPM concentration for all Block Groups, which in this case is `r round(median(me_blkgrp_sf$DSLPM_19, na.rm = TRUE),2)`. Half of the state's Block Groups are below the median and half are above the median. Each dot represents an individual Block Group. Larger black dots on right represent outliers, or Block Groups with unusually high values relative to the state. In this case, outliers would be represented by ozone values greater than `r Outlier`, which occur in `r glue::glue_collapse(me_town_outlier,", ", last = ", and ")`.

### Diesel Particulate Matter in Maine and Populations of Concern

In addition to variations in the general geography of DPM concentrations, exposure to these concentrations also varies demographically. Figure \@ref(fig:barplotDPMPopAvg) below shows population-weighted exposures for populations of concern relative to average DPM concentrations for the state. For example, limited English households in Maine are exposed to  DPM concentrations that are more than 74% above concentrations for the state as a whole. Similarly, minorities are exposed to concentrations more than 39% above the state average. By contrast, adults without a high school diploma are, on average, exposed to concentrations of DPM below the state average.

## Air Toxics Cancer Risk in Maine

Air toxics, often referred to as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), are pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental effects.  

Most air toxics originate from transportation and industry, including automobiles, industrial facilities, and power plants. EPA regulates 187 chemicals under its HAP program. Since 1996, the EPA's National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) program has provided nationwide assessments of outdoor air quality with respect to emissions of air toxics. NATA uses emissions estimates from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), which is updated every three years. The NEI includes all of the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reporting facilities that release hazardous air pollutants, along with many other sources of air pollutants, such as motor vehicles. NATA estimates the cancer risks from breathing these air toxics over a lifetime.[^NATAoverview] 

The analysis of air toxics cancer risk presented here is based on data from the EPA's EJSCREEN.[^EJSCREEN] EJSCREEN data provides lifetime cancer risk from inhalation of air toxics, as risk-in-1 million, at the Census Block Group level for 2014, the latest year of data available from the National Air Toxics Assessment. 

Cancer risks are concentrated along the I-95 corridor from Kittery to Bangor (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapATCNE) below).

### Lifetime Cancer Risk from Inhalation of Air Toxics in Maine and Populations of Concern

In addition to variations in the general geography of cancer risk, exposure to these risks also varies demographically. Figure \@ref(fig:barplotATCPopAvgRI) below shows population-weighted exposures for populations of concern relative to average cancer risk for the state. For example, limited English speaking households in Maine experience cancer risks from inhalation of air toxics that are more than 6% above the state as a whole. Similarly, minorities experience  cancer risks more than 5% above the state average. In fact, all populations concern are exposed to concentrations above the state average.

## Respiratory Hazard Index in Maine

Respiratory hazard from air toxics refers to noncancer effects caused by a lifetime of exposure to air toxics listed as Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs).[^NATAoverview] EPA's National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) program calculates a hazard quotient, which is the ratio of ambient air concentration to a chemical’s health-based reference concentration (RfC). No adverse health effects are expected from exposure if the hazard quotient is less than one. This hazard quotient represents the cumulative impacts of all the relevant air toxics for which respiratory effects were the key health effect.[^NATARfC]

The analysis of respiratory hazard presented here is based on data from the EPA's EJSCREEN.[^EJSCREEN] EJSCREEN data provides respiratory hazard, as a ratio of exposure concentration to a health-based reference concentration (RfC), at the Census Block Group level for 2014, the latest year of data available from the National Air Toxics Assessment.

Higher respiratory hazard indices are concentrated along the I-95 corridor from Kittery to Bangor, and also north of Bethel (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapRHI) below).

The Block Group with highest respiratory hazard index value in the state is found in `r me_town_maxRESP` and the lowest is found in `r me_town_minRESP`.

Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotRHI) is a boxplot of respiratory hazard indices by Block Group . The box represents index values ranging between the 25th and 75th percentiles. The line that divides the box into two parts represents the median respiratory hazard index value for all Block Groups, which in this case is `r round(median(me_blkgrp_sf$RESP_19, na.rm = TRUE),2)`. Half of the state's Block Groups are below the median and half are above the median. Each dot represents an individual Block Group.

### Respiratory Hazard Index from Inhalation of Air Toxics in Maine and Populations of Concern

In addition to variations in the general geography of the respiratory hazard index, exposure to these risks also varies demographically. Figure \@ref(fig:barplotRHIPopAvg) below shows population-weighted exposures for populations of concern relative to average respiratory hazard index for the state. For example, limited English speaking households in Maine experience respiratory hazard indices that are over 10% above the state as a whole. Similarly, minorities experience hazard index values more than 7% above the state average. By contrast, persons over age 64 are exposed to an average hazard index below the state average.

## Traffic Proximity and Volume in Maine

Proximity to motor vehicle traffic is associated with greater exposure to toxic gases and particulate matter, as well as increased noise. Vehicle-related emissions include ultrafine particulates and other components of PM~2.5~, lead and other metals, air toxics such as benzene, nitrogen oxides (NO~x~), hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide (CO), as well as precursors that add to the formation of ground level ozone (O~3~) and smog. Research has repeatedly shown that living near highly trafficked roads is related to increased risk of a variety of adverse health outcomes, including asthma, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke, stress, and increased rates of mortality. EPA’s 2005 National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) estimated that mobile emissions accounted for about 30% of average cancer risk from Hazardous Air Pollutants.[^EJSCREENTraffic]

EPA's EJSCREEN provides an indicator of traffic exposure measured as residential proximity to roads weighted by traffic volume. More specifically, EJSCREEN's Traffic Proximity and Volume indicator is a count of vehicles (average annual daily traffic) at major roads within 500 meters of residential areas (i.e., Census Blocks) divided by distance in kilometers (km).[^EPATraffic] For example, a residential area at 100 meters distance from a single highway with 33,000 AADT (average annual daily traffic) would result in a score of 33,000/100=330, which is approximately the median block group traffic proximity indicator value in New England. The Traffic Proximity and Volume indicator values are aggregated at the Census Block Group level. 

Exposure to high annual daily traffic volume is concentrated along major traffic corridors, as well as within larger municipalities (see Figure \@ref(fig:mapTPV) below). 

```{r mapTPV, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Map of 2017 traffic proximity and volume (calculated as a count of vehicles (average annual daily traffic) at major roads within 500 meters, divided by distance in kilometers (km)) across Maine at Census Block Group level."}

The Block Group with highest Traffic Proximity and Volume value in the state is found in `r me_town_maxTraffic` and the lowest is found in `r me_town_minTraffic`.

Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotTPV) is a boxplot of Traffic Proximity and Volume values by Block Group. The box represents values ranging between the 25th and 75th percentiles. The line that divides the box into two parts represents the median Traffic Proximity and Volume value for all Block Groups, which in this case is `r round(median(me_blkgrp_sf$PTRAF_19, na.rm = TRUE),2)`. Half of the state's Block Groups are below the median and half are above the median. Each dot represents an individual Block Group. The large black dots represent outliers, or unusually high values.

### Traffic Proximity and Volume Exposure in Maine and Populations of Concern

In addition to variations in the general geography of the traffic proximity and volume exposure, this exposure also varies demographically. Figure \@ref(fig:barplotTPVPopAvgNE) below shows population-weighted exposures for populations of concern relative to average traffic proximity and volume for the state. For example, minorities are exposed to traffic proximity and volume more than 180% above the state average. By contrast, persons over age 64 are, on average, are exposed to traffic proximity and volume of more than 16% below the state average. 

```{r barplotTPVPopAvgNE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Population-weighted average Traffic Proximity and Volume (calculated as a count of vehicles (average annual daily traffic) at major roads within 500 meters, divided by distance in kilometers (km)) across Maine at Census Block Group level relative to the state average."}

# Appendix A: Data and Methodology {-}

The analyses presented here are based on data from three sources:

* U.S. EPA's EJSCREEN
  + PM~2.5~
  + Ozone (O~3~)
  + Diesel Particulate Matter
  + Air Toxics Cancer Risk
  + Respiratory Hazard Index from Air Toxics
  + Traffic Proximity and Volume
* Database of Road Transportation Emissions (DARTE)
  + On-road Carbon Dioxide (CO~2~) Emissions
* American Community Survey 5-year Estimates
  + Population demographics
 
## EPA's EJSCREEN {-}

The U.S. EPA's EJSCREEN is an online environmental justice mapping and screening tool that provides a "nationally consistent dataset and approach for combining environmental and demographic indicators."  EJSCREEN provides data on 11 environmental indicators, ranging across air, land, and water. The six indicators analyzed here were chosen based on their relationship to transportation sources, especially motor vehicles. Data for each indicator is available by Census Block Group across the U.S. The 2015 (earliest available) and 2019 (latest available) data sets were downloaded from https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/download-ejscreen-data as CSV files and processed in R. 

All data was analyzed or aggregated geographically by Census Tract and Block Group. A Census Tract is a small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision of a county that contains between 1,200 and 8,000 people. The entire area of a county is covered by Census Tracts, just as the entire area of a state is covered by counties or county equivalents. Census Tracts range in areal size depending on the population density; smaller areas in denser areas and larger areas in less densely populated areas. Census Block Groups are subdivisions of Census Tracts that contain between 600 and 3,000 people. Like Tracts, Block Groups range in areal size depending on the population density of the area. Block Groups are the smallest geographic unit at which detailed demographic and household data from the American Community Survey is made available by the U.S. Census Bureau.  

Below is a summary of the measurement unit and source of each environmental indicator. For more detail on these data sources, see the EJSCREEN Environmental Justice Mapping and Screening Tool: EJSCREEN Technical Documentation 2019. www.epa.gov/ejscreen.

### PM~2.5~ {-}

PM~2.5~ refers to paticulate matter less than 2.5 microns (millionths of a meter) in diameter. PM~2.5~ ambient concentrations are measured as mass in micrograms (millionths of a gram) per cubic meter of air ($\mu$g/m^3^). Ambient concentrations are provided by Census Block Group across the U.S. These concentrations are estimated from a combination of monitoring data and air quality modeling. Ambient PM~2.5~ concentration is estimated by EPA’s Office of Research and Development using a Bayesian space–time downscaling fusion model approach. EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation originally estimated these concentrations at Census Tract level and then assigned the same values to all Block Groups within their respective Tracts. 

PM~2.5~ data from EJSCREEN's 2019 data set is for 2016. PM~2.5~ data from EJSCREEN's 2015 data set is for 2011. 

### Ozone (O~3~) {-}

Ozone (O~3~) refers to ground level (i.e. Tropospheric) ozone formed as a result of chemical interactions between oxides of nitrogen (NO~x~) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. Ambient concentrations of ozone are measured as a summer seasonal average (May to September) of daily maximum 8-hour concentration in air in parts per billion (ppb). Ambient concentrations are provided by Census Block Group across the U.S. These concentrations are estimated from a combination of monitoring data and air quality modeling. Ambient ozone concentration is estimated by EPA’s Office of Research and Development using a Bayesian space–time downscaling fusion model approach. EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation originally estimated these concentrations at Census Tract level and then assigned the same values to all Block Groups within their respective Tracts.

Ozone data from EJSCREEN's 2019 data set is for 2016. Ozone data from EJSCREEN's 2015 data set is for 2011.

### Diesel Particulate Matter {-}

Diesel Particulate Matter (DPM) refers to particulate matter emitted in diesel exhaust and is typically used as a surrogate measure of diesel exhaust more generally. DPM ambient concentrations are measured as mass in micrograms (millionths of a gram) per cubic meter of air ($\mu$g/m^3^). Ambient concentrations are provided by Census Block Group across the U.S. These concentrations are estimated from EPA's National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) program. NATA uses emissions estimates from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), which is updated every three years. The NEI includes all of the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reporting facilities that release hazardous air pollutants, along with many other sources of air pollutants, such as motor vehicles. NATA estimates are at Tract resolution. Each Block Group was assigned the DPM score of the tract containing it.

The 2019 version of EJSCREEN uses 2014 NATA data, which is based on NEI emissions estimates for 2014.

### Air Toxics Cancer Risk {-}

Air Toxics Cancer Risk refers to lifetime risk (i.e. over 70 years) of developing cancer as a result of breathing ambient levels of toxic or Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs). This risk is reported as the risk-in-1 million of developing cancer. EJSCREEN uses the most recent data from EPA’s National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA). NATA estimates cancer risk from the health implications of 138 air pollutants classified as HAPs. NATA uses emissions estimates from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), which is updated every three years. The NEI includes all of the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reporting facilities that release hazardous air pollutants, along with many other sources of air pollutants, such as motor vehicles. NATA estimates are at Tract resolution. Each Block Group was assigned the hazard score of the tract containing it.

The 2019 version of EJSCREEN uses 2014 NATA data, which is based on NEI emissions estimates for 2014. 

### Respiratory Hazard Index {-}

Respiratory Hazard Index refers to noncancer effects caused by a lifetime of exposure to air toxics listed as Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs). EPA's National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) program calculates a hazard quotient, which is the ratio of ambient air concentration to a chemical’s health-based reference concentration (RfC). No adverse health effects are expected from exposure if the hazard quotient is less than one. This hazard quotient represents the cumulative impacts of all the relevant air toxics for which respiratory effects were the key health effect. NATA uses emissions estimates from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), which is updated every three years. The NEI includes all of the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reporting facilities that release hazardous air pollutants, along with many other sources of air pollutants, such as motor vehicles. NATA estimates are at Tract resolution. Each Block Group was assigned the hazard score of the tract containing it.

The 2019 version of EJSCREEN uses 2014 NATA data, which is based on NEI emissions estimates for 2014. 

### Traffic Proximity and Volume {-}

Traffic Proximity and Volume refers to an index of exposure to road traffic. This index is calculated as a count of vehicles (average annual daily traffic) at major roads within 500 meters of residential areas (i.e., Census
Block centroids) divided by distance in kilometers (km). Traffic volume is based on average annual daily traffic (AADT) estimates in the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) dataset in the Department of Transportation (DOT) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). Each Block Group was assigned a Traffic Proximity and Volume score based on a population-weighted average of the scores for the Census Blocks within the respective Block Group. 

The 2019 version of EJSCREEN uses 2017 HPMS data.

## Database of Road Transportation Emissions (DARTE) {-}

The Database of Road Transportation Emissions (DARTE) provides a 38-year, 1-km resolution inventory of annual on-road CO~2~ emissions for the conterminous United States based on roadway-level vehicle traffic data and state-specific emissions factors for multiple vehicle types on urban and rural roads as compiled in the Database of Road Transportation Emissions (DARTE). For more details about DARTE, see the User Guide for DARTE Annual On-road CO2 Emissions on a 1-km Grid, Conterminous USA, V2, 1980-2017 at https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1735.

### On-road Carbon Dioxide (CO~2~) Emissions {-}

DARTE CO~2~ emissions data from the on-road transportation sector are provided annually for 1980-2017 as a continuous surface at a spatial resolution of 1km in the form of GeoTIFF files for each year. The same data is also provided  aggregated to U.S. 2010 Census Block Group polygons. Units of data are total emissions in kilograms of CO~2~ per year for each Block Group. 

For the purposes of this analysis, DARTE Block Group data for the years 1990 to 2017 was downloaded as a geodatabase and processed in R. 

## American Community Survey 5-year Estimates {-}

The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey by the U.S. Census Bureau that provides information on a yearly basis about the U.S. and its people. The ACS provides detailed information on economic, housing, and demographic characteristics about the population that are not captured by the decennial Census. 

The ACS provides greater demographic detail and temporal resolution than the decennial Census, but its geographic resolution is more limited. While the decennial Census is based on an enumeration (i.e., a total count) of everyone in the U.S. once every decade, the ACS is based on a statistical sample of approximately 3.5 million addresses across the country each year. As a result of this sampling approach, the ACS estimates must be pooled, or combined, across multiple years in order to provide reliable estimates for smaller areas (i.e. areas with less than 20,000 people), such as at the Tract or Block Group levels. While it is possible to know the number of low income households across the U.S. annually, one may only know this about a Tract or Block Group based on 5-year estimates. Since 2010, the ACS has published 5-year data (beginning with 2005–2009 estimates) for all geographic areas down to the census Tract and Block Group levels. For more detail on the ACS, see Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: What All Data Users Need to Know at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/handbooks/general.html.

For the purposes of this analysis ACS 5-year estimates for the period 2014 - 2018 for Census Tracts and Block Groups in New England, as well as their associated TIGER/Line spatial files, were downloaded from the Census Bureau via API using the tigris package in R. Demographic variables consistent with those used by the EPA in EJSCREEN were chosen, as well as environmental justice population thresholds used by states where available. Table \@ref(tab:ACSvariables) below lists the demographic variables that were downloaded directly or computed from ACS variables:
```{r ACSvariables}
ACSvDF <- data.frame(Variable = c("Total Population",
                                  "Minority",

## Population-weighted averages {-}

Wherever feasible, population exposure to pollutants or other risks is reported as a population-weighted average. A population weighted-average is equivalent to a weighted mean in which the raw values for which a mean (or average) is calculated are multiplied by a weight factor. For example, we are interested in knowing whether Minorities are exposed to higher average PM~2.5~ concentrations than the general or Total Population. Consider the table below.

```{r wmean1}
data.frame(BG = c("BG1","BG2","BG3","BG4"),
           PM25 = c(2.5,6.2,10,5),
           Minority = c(5,10,20,10),
           NonMinority = c(20,12,5,10)) %>% 
  mutate(TotalPop = Minority + NonMinority) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T, 
                    caption = "Block Group Populations and PM2.5", align = "l") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header"))
```

Population numbers of minorities, as well as the total population, and PM~2.5~ concentrations, are each reported by Block Group. Since each Block Group is associated with one PM~2.5~ concentration value, we might assume (incorrectly) that everyone is equally exposed to the average PM~2.5~ values of all Block Groups (`r round(mean(c(2.5,6.2,10,5)),2)`). However, not all Block Groups have the same number of people, which means that each PM~2.5~ concentration value is associated with a different number of people. Do more Minorities occupy Block Groups with higher concentrations than the simple average would indicate?

To calculate the population-weighted average PM~2.5~ exposure for Minorities, the number of Minorities in each Block Group is used as a 'weight'. The PM~2.5~ concentraions of each Block Group is multiplied by its respective number of Minorities. See the table below. The light gray column on the right is the product of PM~2.5~ values and Minority populations. 

```{r wmean2}
data.frame(BG = c("BG1","BG2","BG3","BG4"),
           PM25 = c(2.5,6.2,10,5),
           Minority = c(5,10,20,10),
           NonMinority = c(20,12,5,10)) %>% 
  mutate(TotalPop = Minority + NonMinority,
         PM25xMinority = PM25*Minority) %>% 
  bind_rows(summarize_all(., funs(if(is.numeric(.)) sum(.) else "Total"))) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T, 
                    caption = "Block Group Populations and PM2.5", align = "l") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header")) %>% 
  kableExtra::row_spec(5, bold = TRUE) %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(6, bold = TRUE, background = "#d3d3d3")
```

The total or sum of the products (i.e., Minority pop x PM~2.5~ concentrations) is then divided by the sum of the weights (i.e., total Minority), so that 324.5/45 = `r round(324.5/45,2)`. The result is a weighted average PM~2.5~ concentration that is influenced by the number of minorities. 

This process is repeated for the Total Population so that the two population-weighted average PM~2.5~ concentrations can be compared. Below is the calculation of population-weighted calculation for the total population. 

```{r wmean3}
data.frame(BG = c("BG1","BG2","BG3","BG4"),
           PM25 = c(2.5,6.2,10,5),
           Minority = c(5,10,20,10),
           NonMinority = c(20,12,5,10)) %>% 
  mutate(TotalPop = Minority + NonMinority,
         PM25xTotalPop = PM25*TotalPop) %>% 
  bind_rows(summarize_all(., funs(if(is.numeric(.)) sum(.) else "Total"))) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T, 
                    caption = "Block Group Populations and PM2.5", align = "l") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header")) %>% 
  kableExtra::row_spec(5, bold = TRUE) %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(6, bold = TRUE, background = "#d3d3d3")
```

For the TotalPop, the population-weighted average of PM~2.5~ is 548.9/92 = `r round(548.9/92,2)`. Thus we can see that Minorities experience a higher population-weighted average PM~2.5~ concentration than the general or total population.
