# Perform NLCD raster-to-vector conversion, vector erase/difference, and vector intersections in ArcMap because it takes too long in R. 
# In ArcMap:
# Convert NLCD raster to shapefile. Clip to state.
# Isolate undeveloped areas (gridcode NOT 22 - 24). 
# Erase areas of block groups and tracts that overlap with undeveloped areas in NLCD shapefiles. Compute OldArea of erased polygons in sqm to identify area of developed polygons remaining.

## Access to Public Transit

This analysis seeks to identify communities that are underserved by access to public transit. Access to transit is measured in terms of distance to transit boarding stops and in terms of frequency of service. 

Massachusetts is served by `r length(unique(ma_busRoutesAll_sf$AGENCY))`
regional public transit agencies, as well as a number of private operators. These transit services include buses, rapid transit (i.e., subway or light rail), commuter rail, and park-in-ride lots served by public and private buses or shuttles. Amtrak train service passes through Massachusetts as well, but it is not included in this analysis. Ferry services, water taxis, and other seasonal transportation services are not considered in this analysis. The analysis below evaluates access to bus, rapid transit, and commuter rail separately, as well as access to any mode of transit. Figure \@ref(fig:transitMap) shows `r formatC(nrow(ma_busRoutesAll_sf),big.mark = ",")` fixed public transit routes across the state along with population density.

Approximately `r paste0(round(ma_transitAccessPops_df %>% filter(Group == "Total Pop") %>% dplyr::select(PctBus) %>% pull(),1),"%")` of the state population lives within reasonable walking distance of a bus stop (defined as approximately 400 meters or 1/4 mile), 
 `r paste0(round(ma_transitAccessPops_df %>% filter(Group == "Total Pop") %>% dplyr::select(PctRapidTransit) %>% pull(),1),"%")` live within 1/2 mile of a rapid transit stop, `r paste0(round(ma_transitAccessPops_df %>% filter(Group == "Total Pop") %>% dplyr::select(PctCommuter) %>% pull(),1),"%")` live within 3 miles of a commuter rail stop, and `r paste0(round(ma_transitAccessPops_df %>% filter(Group == "Total Pop") %>% dplyr::select(PctAllTransit) %>% pull(),1),"%")` live within reasonable distance of any transit. 

However, this access varies by population group and by mode of transit. Figures \@ref(fig:loliBusDist) to \@ref(fig:loliAllTransitDist) below compare the percentages of different population groups living within reasonable walking distance of bus stops (1/4 mile), rapid transit (1/2 mile), and commuter rail or park-in-ride stops (3 miles) across the state, respectively. Most populations of concern, including transit-dependent groups, have access similar to or better than the general population. However, note that people over age 64 and under 18 have consistently less access to transit on average compared to the general population.

The population percentages above provide a glimpse of average access to public transit across the state for different population groups. However, access also varies for specific communities. Indeed, it is important to consider vulnerable populations or transportation-limited populations that do not have reasonable access to transit.

Figures \@ref(fig:mapBusAccessO64) to \@ref(fig:mapTransitAccessO64) below highlight developed portions of Census Block Groups across Massachusetts without reasonable access to bus, rapid transit, commuter rail and park-in-ride lots, or any mode of transit, respectively, and the numbers of persons over 64 who live there. Tables \@ref(tab:tabBusAccessO64) to \@ref(tab:tabTransitAccessO64) show breakdowns of the same by municipality. For example, Table \@ref(tab:tabBusAccessO64) shows that `r formatC(as.numeric(BusNoAccess1[1,3]),big.mark=",")` people over 64 across `r BusNoAccess1[1,2]` Block Groups in `r BusNoAccess1[1,1]` resided one or more miles from the nearest bust stop. These people represented `r BusNoAccess1[1,4]` of people over 64 in `r BusNoAccess1[1,1]`. Similarly, Table \@ref(tab:tabTransitAccessO64) shows that `r formatC(as.numeric(TransitNoAccess1[1,3]),big.mark=",")` people over 64 across `r TransitNoAccess1[1,2]` Block Groups in `r TransitNoAccess1[1,1]` resided one or more miles from the nearest transit stop for any mode. These people represented `r TransitNoAccess1[1,4]` of people over 64 in `r TransitNoAccess1[1,1]`.
Maps and tables of other populations of concern without access to the various modes of transit can be found in Appendix B.

## Frequency of Transit Service
The quality of access to public transit can also be assessed by the level or frequency of service, which is measured by "headway." Headway describes the time between transit vehicle arrivals at a transit stop. For example, a bus route with a 15 minute headway would mean that the bus arrives at a given stop four times an hour (it's frequency), or once every 15 minutes. Transit headways are affected by the scheduled frequency of service, the number of vehicles on a given route, traffic delays, and dispatch management of vehicle spacing.[^mindGap] Headways are significant because they affect the desirability and useability of transit service.[^headways] Headways can affect:

* average wait times
* the amount of planning and preparation needed to use transit and stay on schedule
* the amount of time lost when transit schedules do not directly conform to work, school, or activity schedules
* the time penalty for missing a train or bus
* public use or support of transit

Headways are significant for transit dependent populations and can affect the quality of life and economic opportunities of transit riders. Figure \@ref(fig:mapGTFSbus) below shows average scheduled headways for bus routes throughout Massachusetts.[^headwayReal] Headways vary significantly by route and by type of service across the state.

The average population-weighted headway for all bus routes in the state is `r round(ma_busHeadwayPops_df %>% filter(Group == "Total Pop") %>% select(AvgWHeadway) %>% pull(),1)` minutes. However headways, or service frequencies, vary significantly across population groups. Figure \@ref(fig:loliBusHeadway) below compares the population-weighted average bus headways for different groups across the state. Most groups have average headways shorter than the general population. However, persons over age 64 have headways that exceed that of the general population (`r round(ma_busHeadwayPops_df %>% filter(Group == "Over 64") %>% select(AvgWHeadway) %>% pull(),1)` minutes). The shortest population-weighted average headway, experienced by limited English speaking households, as defined by Massachusetts environmental justice policy, is `r round(ma_busHeadwayPops_df %>% arrange(AvgWHeadway) %>% slice(.,1) %>% select(AvgWHeadway) %>% pull(),0)` minutes.

Rapid transit routes, which are localized to Boston and adjacent municipalities, show considerably shorter average headways than bus routes. Figure \@ref(fig:mapGTFSrapidTransit) shows average headways by line, and Table \@ref(tab:tabGTFSrapidTransit) shows a breakdown of headway times by route. The average population-weighted headway for all rapid transit routes in the state is `r round(ma_RTHeadwayPops_df %>% filter(Group == "Total Pop") %>% select(AvgWHeadway) %>% pull(),1)` minutes. However headways, or service frequencies, vary significantly across population groups. Figure \@ref(fig:loliRTHeadway) below compares the population-weighted average rapid transit headways for different groups within reasonable walking distance of stops. More than half of the groups have average headways longer than the general population. Adults without a high school diploma have the longest population-weighted average headways (`r round(ma_RTHeadwayPops_df %>% filter(Group == "No HS Dip") %>% select(AvgWHeadway) %>% pull(),1)` minutes). The shortest population-weighted average headway, experienced by limited English speaking households, as defined by Massachusetts environmental justice policy, is `r round(ma_RTHeadwayPops_df %>% arrange(AvgWHeadway) %>% slice(.,1) %>% select(AvgWHeadway) %>% pull(),1)` minutes.

Headways for commuter rail routes are slightly shorter on average than bus routes. Figure \@ref(fig:mapGTFScommuterRail) shows average headways by line and Table \@ref(tab:tabGTFSrapidCommuterRail) shows a breakdown of headway times by route. The average population-weighted headway for all commuter rail routes in the state is `r round(ma_CRHeadwayPops_df %>% filter(Group == "Total Pop") %>% select(AvgWHeadway) %>% pull(),1)` minutes. However headways, or service frequencies, vary significantly across population groups. Figure \@ref(fig:loliCRHeadway) below compares the population-weighted average commuter rail headways for different groups within 3 miles (4800m) of stops. Most groups have average headways shorter than the general population. However, persons over 64 have population-weighted average headways longer than the general population (`r round(ma_CRHeadwayPops_df %>% filter(Group == "Over 64") %>% select(AvgWHeadway) %>% pull(),1)` minutes).

The population-weighted average headways above provide a glimpse of average headways across the state for different population groups and for different transit modes. However, headways also vary for specific communities. Indeed, it is important to consider populations of concern or transportation-limited populations that experience excessively long headways or low service frequency. Figures \@ref(fig:mapHeadwayOver64bus) to \@ref(fig:mapHeadwayOver64CR) below highlight communities of persons over 64 and adults without a high school diploma who are within reasonable distance of bus stops (i.e., 400m or 1/4 mile), rapid transit stops (i.e., 800m or 1/2 mile), and commuter rail stops (i.e., 4800m or 3 miles), but where the mean headway for these stops exceeds the 80th percentile of mean route headways for the state. Tables \@ref(tab:tabHeadwayOver64bus) to \@ref(tab:tabHeadwayOver64commuterRail) show breakdowns by municipality. For example, Table \@ref(tab:tabHeadwayOver64bus) shows that `r formatC(as.numeric(headway80_bus[1,3]),big.mark=",",digits = 5)` people over 64 across `r headway80_bus[1,2]` Block Groups in `r headway80_bus[1,1]` resided in areas where the average headway of accessible transit stops exceeded `r quantile(ma_routes_sf_Bus$mean_headways,0.8)` minutes. These people represented `r headway80_bus[1,4]` of people over 64 in `r headway80_bus[1,1]`. Similarly, Table \@ref(tab:tabHeadwayDisabledRT) shows that `r formatC(as.numeric(headway80_rapidTransit[1,3]),big.mark=",")` people with disabilities across `r headway80_rapidTransit[1,2]` Census Tracts in `r headway80_rapidTransit[1,1]` resided in areas where the average headway of accessible transit stops exceeded `r quantile(ma_routes_sf_RT$mean_headways,0.8)` minutes. These people represented `r headway80_rapidTransit[1,4]` of people with disabilities in `r headway80_rapidTransit[1,1]`.
Maps and tables of other populations of concern with excessive headways can be found in Appendix B.

## Walkability

More walkable communities are positively associated with a variety of quality of life and public health benefits. Conversely, less walkable communities are associated with a range of public health challenges, including higher rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[^WalkCardio] The walkability of neighborhoods is increasingly regarded as an important component of healthier and more sustainable communities, particularly with regard to reducing motor vehicle travel and promoting alternative modes of transport that are more affordable, accessible, and less polluting.  

The National Walkability Index is a nationwide geographic data resource produced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that ranks Census Block Groups according to their relative walkability.[^Walkability] Walkability was modeled based on characteristics of the built environment that influence the likelihood of walking being used as a mode of travel. These characteristics of Block Groups include:

* mix of employment types (greater mix = more walkable)
* amount or density of occupied housing (higher density = more walkable)
* street intersection density (higher density = more walkable)
* proportion of workers who carpool (more carpooling = more walkable)

Figure \@ref(fig:mapWalkability) shows walkability scores by Census Block Group across Massachusetts.  Walkability varies across the state. It is highest in and around the state's major urban centers, such as the Boston area, Springfield, Holyoke, Lawrence, Lowell, Pittsfield, and urbanized areas of the Cape.

Walkability varies for different population groups across the state. Figure \@ref(fig:loliWalkability) below compares population-weighted average walkability index scores for different populations. The average population-weighted walkability score across Massachusetts is `r round(ma_wAvgWalkability_df %>% filter(Group == "Total Pop") %>% select(wNatWalkIndex) %>% pull(),1)`. Most groups live in communities with walkability index scores that are at or above that of the general population. However, persons over age 64 and under 18 tend to live in communities with walkability scores below the state average.

The population-weighted average walkability scores provide a glimpse of average walkability across the state for different population groups. However, walkability also varies for specific communities. Indeed, it is important to consider populations of concern that reside in communities with low walkability. Figures \@ref(fig:mapLowWalkO64) and \@ref(fig:mapLowWalkU18) below highlight Census Block Groups across Massachusetts that are least walkable and the numbers of persons over 64 or under 18 live there. Tables \@ref(tab:tabLowWalkO64) and \@ref(tab:tabLowWalkU18) show breakdowns by municipality. For example, Table \@ref(tab:tabLowWalkO64) shows that `r formatC(as.numeric(leastWalkable1[1,3]),big.mark=",")` people over 64 across `r leastWalkable1[1,2]` Block Groups in `r leastWalkable1[1,1]` resided in the least walkable areas. These people represented `r leastWalkable1[1,4]` of people over 64 in `r leastWalkable1[1,1]`. Similarly, Table \@ref(tab:tabLowWalkU18) shows that `r formatC(as.numeric(leastWalkable2[1,3]),big.mark=",")` people under 18 across `r TransitNoAccess1[1,2]` Block Groups in `r leastWalkable2[1,1]` resided the least walkable areas. These people represented `r leastWalkable2[1,4]` of people under 18 in `r leastWalkable2[1,1]`.
Maps and tables of other populations of concern in the least walkable Block Groups can be found in Appendix B.

## Transportation Cost Burden

Transportation is the second-largest expenditure category for American households, approximately 16% of annual expenditures on average between 2015 and 2018.[^Expenditures] Only housing costs (~32%) exceed those of transportation. The high cost of transportation is due in large part to the costs of dependence on private vehicle ownership, including purchase and financing, insurance, maintenance, and fuel costs. Households without reasonable access to other modes of transportation typically experience higher transportation costs.[^CostBurden] Transportation costs can be significant economic burdens for moderate and lower income households and for communities where destinations are distant or limited. For many working-class and rural households, transportation costs exceed housing costs. 

The Location Affordability Index (LAI) is a nationwide geographic data resource developed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Transportation under the federal Partnership for Sustainable Communities.[^LAIabout] The LAI was developed as a way of integrating both housing and transportation costs into estimates of the affordability of specific neighborhoods and cities. The LAI provides estimated total expenses from transportation, whether transit or motor vehicle, as well as transportation cost as a percentage of household income, for eight different household types — which vary by household income, size, and number of commuters — at the Census Tract level. For the purposes of this analysis, transportation costs as a percentage of income for moderate-income households (households with one commuter making 80% or less of area median household income) was used as a proxy to represent transportation cost burden for all areas. LAI data were also downscaled to the Block Group level for the purpose of demographic analyses and comparisons (see Appendix B Data and Methodology).

Figure \@ref(fig:mapLAI) below shows transportation cost burden (i.e., transportation cost as a percentage of household income) by Census Tract across Massachusetts. Transportation cost burden varies across the state. It is lowest in and around the state's major urban centers, and it is highest in central and western parts of the state. In `r nrow(lai_ToverH)` Census Tracts, the transportation cost burden exceeds the cost burden of housing.

Transportation cost burden varies for different population groups across the state. Figure \@ref(fig:loliLAI) below compares population-weighted average transportation cost burden for different populations. Most groups live in communities with transportation cost burdens that are below that of the general population. However, persons over age 64 and under 18 tend to live in communities with transportation cost burdens that exceed the state average.

The population-weighted average transportation cost burden values provide a glimpse of average transportation cost burden across the state for different population groups. However, transportation cost burden also varies for specific communities. Indeed, it is important to consider populations of concern that reside in communities with a high transportation cost burden. Figures \@ref(fig:mapHiBurdenO64) and \@ref(fig:mapHiBurdenU18) below highlight Census Block Groups across Massachusetts where the transportation cost burden is in the highest quintile (i.e., 80th percentile) and the numbers of persons over 64 or under 18 that live there. Tables \@ref(tab:tabHiBurdenO64) and \@ref(tab:tabHiBurdenU18) show breakdowns by municipality. For example, Table \@ref(tab:tabHiBurdenO64) shows that `r formatC(as.numeric(HiBurden1[1,3]),big.mark=",")` people over 64 across `r HiBurden1[1,2]` Block Groups in `r HiBurden1[1,1]` resided in areas with the highest transportation cost burden. These people represented `r HiBurden1[1,4]` of people over 64 in `r HiBurden1[1,1]`. Similarly, Table \@ref(tab:tabHiBurdenU18) shows that `r formatC(as.numeric(HiBurden2[1,3]),big.mark=",")` people under 18 across `r HiBurden2[1,2]` Block Groups in `r HiBurden2[1,1]` resided in areas with the highest transportation cost burden. These people represented `r HiBurden2[1,4]` of people under 18 in `r HiBurden2[1,1]`.
Maps and tables of other populations of concern in areas with the highest transportation cost burden can be found in Appendix B.

# Appendix A: Data and Methodology {-}

The analyses presented here are based on data from six sources:

* Massachusetts transit network
* MRLC National Land Cover Database (NLCD)
* General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)
* US EPA Walkability Index
* US Department of Housing and Urban Development Location Affordability Index
* American Community Survey 5-year Estimates
  + Population demographics

## Massachusetts transit network {-}

The transit route linework and transit stop locations for Massachusetts  were downloaded from MassGIS at  https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massgis-bureau-of-geographic-information and the MassDOT Open Data Portal at https://geo-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/. A resident is considered to have access if she is within one‐quarter mile of an MBTA bus stop, one‐half mile of a rapid transit (i.e. subway or light rail) station, and up to three miles of a commuter rail station or park-in-ride lot. This geographic definition of access is consistent with FTA Circular 4702.1B Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients, Chapter IV‐14, as well as decades of research on transit behavior, and the judgment of most planners and transit researchers.[^TransitDistance] 

To identify the populations with access to transit, 400 meter, 800 meter, and 4800 meter buffers were generated around all bus, rapid transit, and commuter rail stops and park-in-ride lots, respectively. The transit buffer was intersected with the developed portions of Census Block Groups. Developed portions of Census Block Groups were identified based upon the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), using a process of areal apportionment (see below). The population with access to transit was calculated as the product of the  areal proportion of the intersecting buffer and developed Block Group polygons:

*Population with transit access = Proportion of developed Block Group Intersection x Population of developed Block Group*

For example, if 10% of the developed area of a Census Block Group intersected/overlapped with the 400m buffer around transit stops, it was assumed that 10% of the population has access to those transit stops. Assuming a population of 100 people in the developed portion of the Block Group, this would mean *100 x .10 = 10* people would have access to transit via those stops.

The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) provides nationwide data on land cover and land cover change at a 30m resolution with a 16-class legend based on a modified Anderson Level II classification system:

```{r NLCDtab}
gridCodes <- c(11,12,21,22,23,24,31,41,42,43,51,52,71,72,73,74,81,82,90,95)

landUse <- c("Open Water", "Perennial Ice/Snow", "Developed, Open Space", "Developed, Low Intensity", "Developed, Medium Intensity", "Developed, High Intensity", "Barren Land (Rock/Sand/Clay)", "Deciduous Forest", "Evergreen Forest", "Mixed Forest", "Dwarf Scrub", "Shrub/Scrub", "Grassland/Herbaceous", "Sedge/Herbaceous", "Lichens", "Moss", "Pasture/Hay", "Cultivated Crops", "Woody Wetlands", "Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands")

data.frame(gridCodes,landUse) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T,
                    col.names = c("GMAD Code","Land Use Description"),
                    caption = "NLCD 2016 Land Cover Codes and Classifications", align = "l") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header"))
```

The NLCD is produced by the US Geological Survey (USGS) in partnership with several federal agencies as part of the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC).[^NLCD2016] NLCD identified land cover types based on semi-automated land use calssification algorithms applied to LANDSAT satellite imagery and supplemented with ancillary data.[^NLCDdetails] NLCD is distributed as a raster GeoTIFF at https://www.mrlc.gov/data. 

NLCD data was used to identify developed areas of Census Block Groups in order to better estimate where people are most likely to reside, and thus improve estimates of access to transit based on physical distance.[^Dasymetric] The NLCD 2016 was downloaded and converted to a vector polygon layer and clipped to New England states. Undeveloped polygon areas were extracted (all GMAD codes excluding 22 - 24; see Table \@ref(tab:NLCDtab)). These undeveloped areas of the NLCD polygon layer were then used to erase overlapping areas of Census Block Groups. The latter step served to eliminate areas of Census Block Groups that were classified as undeveloped and thus unlikely to be occupied by residences. The remaining developed areas of Census Block Groups were assumed to contain all populations assigned to that respective Block Group. Processing of NLCD and developed Census Block Groups was done in ArcGIS Desktop 10.7. These developed Census Block Group polygons were used for identifying populations with access to public transit.


## General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) {-}

The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. Public transit agencies increasingly publish their transit data electronically via GTFS "feeds" primarily to allow software developers to create applications which can tap into these feeds and provide users with detailed or timely transit schedules or route planning.[^GTFSStaticOverview] GTFS is also increasingly used by transportation researchers because it provides an efficient way to acquire detailed scheduling and routing information for transit networks. While GTFS feeds can provide real-time data on vehicle movements and locations, most data is provided as static schedules, and vehicle frequencies and headways are inferred from the schedule. 

GTFS data for the Massachusetts transit agencies were acquired from MBTA and Transit data for developers at https://www.mass.gov/lists/mbta-and-transit-data-for-developers. GTFS data was processed using the `tidytransit` package in R. Schedules for all routes running Monday through Friday, 6am to 9pm, were extracted. Headways for each transit stop on these routes was then calculated based on route schedules, and these headways were also averaged for each route.

To calculate headways experienced by different population groups, transit stop points with calculated headways were intersected with the developed portions of Census Block Groups and that were within 400m, 800m, and 4800m of these stops for buses, rapid transit, and commuter rail, respectively. Headways for these intersecting stops were then aggregated to provide mean headways for their intersecting Block Groups. Populations within those intersecting Block Groups were assumed to be subject to those mean headways. 


## US EPA Walkability Index {-}

The National Walkability Index is a nationwide geographic data resource produced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that ranks Census Block Groups according to their relative walkability.[^Walkability] Walkability was modeled based on characteristics of the built environment that influence the likelihood of walking being used as a mode of travel. These characteristics of Block Groups include:

* mix of employment types (greater mix = more walkable)
* amount or density of occupied housing (higher density = more walkable)
* street intersection density (higher density = more walkable)
* proportion of workers who carpool (more carpooling = more walkable)

The Walkability Index was downloaded as a shapefile from the US EPA's Smart Location Mapping website at https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping#walkability. To compare walkability index values with disabled populations and households without a car, Block Group walkability index values were aggregated to the overlying Census Tract as simple averages. Population-weighted averages for the walkability index were also computed for Block Groups and Tracts to compare population groups. 


## US Department of Housing and Urban Development Location Affordability Index {-}

The Location Affordability Index (LAI) is a nationwide geographic data resource developed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Transportation under the federal Partnership for Sustainable Communities.[^LAIabout] The LAI was developed as a way of integrating both housing and transportation costs into estimates of the affordability of specific neighborhoods and cities. The LAI provides estimated total expenses from transportation, whether transit or motor vehicle, as well as transportation cost as a percentage of household income, for eight different household types — which vary by household income, size, and number of commuters — at the Census Tract level. For this analysis Location Affordability Index Model Version 3 (LAIM Version 3 or LAIM3), released in March 2019, was used. LAIM Version 3 estimates housing and transportation costs for eight different household profiles, to focus on the impact of the built environment on these costs by holding demographic characteristics constant. These household profiles are described in Table \@ref(tab:tabLAIprofiles). The LAI can be interpreted as the percentage of the specified household profile’s income that would be needed to cover housing, transportation, or combined costs if that household type were to live in the specified Census Tract. So, for example, a household profile (such as single-parent family) with a housing LAI of 40% would be expected to pay 40% of their income for housing if they lived in the specified location. Details on how housing and transportation costs were modeled are descrbed in the Location Affordability Index Version 3 Data and Methodology document. 

```{r tabLAIprofiles}
data.frame(hhProfile = c("Median-Income Family", "Very Low-Income Individual", "Working Individual", "Single Professional", "Retired Couple", "Single-Parent Family", "Moderate-Income Family", "Dual-Professional Family"),
hhhIncome = c("MHHI", "National poverty line", "50% of MHHI", "135% of MHHI", "80% of MHHI", "50% of MHHI", "80% of MHHI", "150% of MHHI"),
hhSize = c(4,1,1,1,2,3,3,4),
Commuters = c(2,1,1,1,0,1,1,2)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T, 
                    caption = "Location Affordability Index Household Profiles", 
                    align = "l",
                    col.names = c("Household Profile","Income","Household Size","Commuters")) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header","striped")) %>% 
  kableExtra::footnote(., general = "MHHI = Median household income for a given area (CBSA or County)")
```

For the purposes of this analysis, transportation costs as a percentage of income for moderate-income households (three-member households with one commuter making 80% or less of area median household income) was used as a proxy to represent transportation cost burden for all areas. LAI data were also downscaled to the Block Group level for the purpose of demographic analyses and comparisons. Census Block Groups belonging to a given Census Tract were assigned the same value as the overlying Tract. 


## American Community Survey 5-year Estimates {-}

The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey by the U.S. Census Bureau that provides information on a yearly basis about the U.S. and its people. The ACS provides detailed information on economic, housing, and demographic characteristics about the population that are not captured by the decennial Census. 

The ACS provides greater demographic detail and temporal resolution than the decennial Census, but its geographic resolution is more limited. While the decennial Census is based on an enumeration (i.e., a total count) of everyone in the U.S. once every decade, the ACS is based on a statistical sample of approximately 3.5 million addresses across the country each year. As a result of this sampling approach, the ACS estimates must be pooled, or combined, across multiple years in order to provide reliable estimates for smaller areas (i.e. areas with less than 20,000 people), such as at the Tract or Block Group levels. While it is possible to know the number of low income households across the U.S. annually, one may only know this about a Tract or Block Group based on 5-year estimates. Since 2010, the ACS has published 5-year data (beginning with 2005–2009 estimates) for all geographic areas down to the census Tract and Block Group levels. For more detail on the ACS, see Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: What All Data Users Need to Know at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/handbooks/general.html.

All data was analyzed or aggregated geographically by Census Tract and Block Group. A Census Tract is a small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision of a county that contains between 1,200 and 8,000 people. The entire area of a county is covered by Census Tracts, just as the entire area of a state is covered by counties or county equivalents. Census Tracts range in areal size depending on the population density; areal size is smaller in denser areas and larger in less densely populated areas. Census Block Groups are subdivisions of Census Tracts that contain between 600 and 3,000 people. Like Tracts, Block Groups range in areal size depending on the population density of the area. Block Groups are the smallest geographic unit at which detailed demographic and household data from the American Community Survey is made available by the Census. 

For the purposes of this analysis ACS 5-year estimates for the period 2014 - 2018 for Census Tracts and Block Groups in Massachusetts, as well as their associated TIGER/Line spatial files, were downloaded from the Census Bureau via API using the `tigris` package in R. Demographic variables consistent with those used by the EPA in EJSCREEN were chosen, as well as environmental justice population thresholds used by states where available. Table \@ref(tab:ACSvariables) below lists the demographic variables that were downloaded directly or computed from ACS variables:

## Population-weighted averages {-}

Wherever feasible, averages are reported as population-weighted averages. A population weighted-average is equivalent to a weighted mean in which the raw values for which a mean (or average) is calculated are multiplied by a weight factor. For example, we are interested in knowing whether Minorities experience longer headways than the general or Total Population. Consider the table below.

```{r wmean1}
data.frame(BG = c("BG1","BG2","BG3","BG4"),
           Headway = c(65,75,85,70),
           Minority = c(5,10,20,10),
           NonMinority = c(20,12,5,10)) %>% 
  mutate(TotalPop = Minority + NonMinority) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T, 
                    caption = "Block Group Populations and Headways", align = "l") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header"))
```

Population numbers of minorities, as well as the total population, and headways, are each reported by Block Group. Since each Block Group is associated with one headway value, we might assume (incorrectly) that everyone is equally exposed to the average headways of all Block Groups (`r round(mean(c(65,75,85,70)),2)`). However, not all Block Groups have the same number or categories of people, which means that each headway value is associated with a different number of people. Do Minorities occupy Block Groups with higher headways than the simple average would indicate?

To calculate the population-weighted average headway for Minorities, the number of Minorities in each Block Group is used as a 'weight'. The headway of each Block Group is multiplied by its respective number of Minorities. See the table below. 

```{r wmean2}
data.frame(BG = c("BG1","BG2","BG3","BG4"),
           Headway = c(65,75,85,70),
           Minority = c(5,10,20,10),
           NonMinority = c(20,12,5,10)) %>% 
  mutate(TotalPop = Minority + NonMinority,
         HeadwayxMinority = Headway*Minority) %>% 
  bind_rows(summarize_all(., funs(if(is.numeric(.)) sum(.) else "Total"))) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T, 
                    caption = "Block Group Populations and Headway", 
                    align = "l") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header")) %>% 
  kableExtra::row_spec(5, bold = TRUE) %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(6, bold = TRUE, background = "#d3d3d3")
```

The total or sum of the products (i.e., Minority pop x Headway) is then divided by the sum of the weights (i.e., total Minority population), so that 3475/45 = `r round(3475/45,2)`. The result is a weighted average headway that is influenced by the number of minorities. 

This process is repeated for the Total Population so that the two population-weighted average headways can be compared. Below is the calculation of population-weighted calculation for the total population. 

```{r wmean3}
data.frame(BG = c("BG1","BG2","BG3","BG4"),
           Headway = c(65,75,85,70),
           Minority = c(5,10,20,10),
           NonMinority = c(20,12,5,10)) %>% 
  mutate(TotalPop = Minority + NonMinority,
         TempxTotalPop = Headway*TotalPop) %>% 
  bind_rows(summarize_all(., funs(if(is.numeric(.)) sum(.) else "Total"))) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(longtable = T, booktabs = T, 
                    caption = "Block Group Populations and Headway", 
                    align = "l") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header")) %>% 
  kableExtra::row_spec(5, bold = TRUE) %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(6, bold = TRUE, background = "#d3d3d3")
```

For the TotalPop, the population-weighted average headway is 6800/92 = `r round(6800/92,2)`. Thus we can see that Minorities experience a higher population-weighted average headway than the general or total population.
