# Investing for Equity in New England

Transportation systems are crucial for the social and economic wellbeing of our society and our communities, and they are also major sources of environmental burden and inequity. This study analyzed the distribution of transportation-related burdens (e.g., pollution) and benefits (e.g., transit access) across the six New England states and the relationship of these burdens and benefits to priority populations. The goal is to provide guidance on policy recommendations for transportation investments that promote social and environmental equity and mitigate or prevent disparities and inequities in access to benefits and exposure to burdens.
